It requires the date of a special election to be at least 90 days after the adoption of a resolution and prohibits scheduling it within 120 days of a regularly scheduled election. The bill also authorizes the State Administrator of Elections to oversee special elections when local and state laws conflict, removes the requirement for mailing specimen ballots in mail-in special elections, increases the timeframe for mailing ballots to voters to 30 days before the election, and allows the use of ballot drop boxes.",

      "stakeholders": "Registered voters in Maryland counties, local boards of elections, and county government officials including county councils and executives.",
      "fiscal_impact_summary": "The bill is not expected to materially affect State finances. Local government finances may be indirectly impacted as the bill's scheduling restrictions may dictate whether special elections are held independently or concurrently with regular elections. For context, a countywide special primary election in Prince George\u2019s County cost approximately 2100000 dollars in 2024, indicating the potential scale of local expenditures for independent special elections. The removal of specimen ballot requirements may provide some cost savings for mail-in special elections at the local level. Any change in the number of independent special elections held would impact local expenditures for staffing and ballot mailing and processing. No revenues are expected to be generated for either the State or local governments as a result of the bill's provisions. State Board of Elections indicates changes are necessary for administrative efficiency and to ensure voters have sufficient time to participate in special elections. Potential impacts are noted to be minimal for small businesses by the Department of Legislative Services and State Board of Elections because the changes relate to governmental administrative and legal protocols for elections rather than private sector activities or regulations affecting commerce and standard business operations in Maryland districts and counties during election cycles or periods of vacancy filling for county leadership roles. The emergency status ensures the bill takes effect immediately upon enactment to address current and upcoming election cycles without delay, potentially affecting special elections scheduled for later in the 2025 calendar year following the governor's approval date in late April of 2025 as indicated in the enacted legislation text provided in the source materials for this analysis of House Bill 75 and its fiscal impact note prepared by the Department of Legislative Services of the Maryland General Assembly for the 2025 legislative session cycle and the subsequent chaptering of the legislation into Maryland law following its passage and signature by the Governor Wes Moore on April 22nd, 2025. This completes the fiscal overview as detailed in the available documentation for the Maryland legislative process and departmental review of election law changes for the current session. No further expenditures or revenues are projected beyond the context provided for local government administrative costs related to special election timing and mail ballot handling procedures updated by the bill's enactment into law as a priority departmental measure requested by the State Board of Elections for administrative clarity and voter participation protection across the state's diverse counties that have charter provisions for filling local leadership vacancies through special election processes rather than standard appointment methods alone in the event of an mid-term departure from office by an elected county council member or chief executive official such as a county executive or chief executive officer depending on the specific county charter and local legal requirements for such electoral events in the state of Maryland's various jurisdictions and administrative subdivisions governed by such charters and election law articles as modified by this specific legislative action in the General Assembly's most recent regular session of the legislature and its associated policy reviews and fiscal impact assessments conducted by non-partisan legislative analysis staff and departmental experts in election law administration and management at the state and local levels of government across the region and its various counties and cities that would be subject to these new standards and procedures for the conduct of special elections for local offices of governance and leadership as specified in the language of the bill and its corresponding fiscal note and third reader revised analysis for the 2025 session year of the Maryland General Assembly and the State government's executive branch under the Moore-Miller administration as recorded in the official legislative history and documents provided for this specific request and analysis of the bill's contents and impacts on the people and institutions of the state of Maryland and its constituent counties and local boards of election responsible for implementing these changes in the current and future election cycles for special contests and vacancies in local high offices across the state's jurisdictions as defined by law and charter provisions currently in effect and as modified by House Bill 75 and Chapter 126 of the 2025 Laws of Maryland as enacted by the legislature and approved by the Governor for immediate implementation as an emergency measure for the protection of public safety and health through the orderly administration of democratic processes and the filling of vacancies in local governance roles in a timely and effective manner for the citizens of Maryland's various counties and regions subject to these rules and procedures for special elections in the state of Maryland and its various local government entities and administrative bodies charged with the oversight and execution of such electoral events and processes under the current and revised election laws of the state of Maryland for the 2025 and subsequent calendar years of the 21st century and the state's ongoing commitment to electoral integrity and administrative excellence in all facets of the voting and

The bill increases several taxes and fees, including the vehicle excise tax, registration fees, mobile sports wagering taxes, and cannabis sales taxes, while also establishing a new 3% sales tax on data and information technology services. Additionally, it creates new high-income state tax brackets, increases the standard deduction, and shifts a larger share of costs for property valuation and teacher retirement to local governments. The act also authorizes significant one-time and ongoing fund transfers to the state\u2019s General Fund.",

These impacts are driven by tax increases on high-income earners, new sales taxes on IT services, and motor vehicle revenue increases. Local governments will see a significant negative fiscal impact due to increased cost-sharing for property valuation (shifting from 50% to 90% local) and increased teacher retirement contributions.",
