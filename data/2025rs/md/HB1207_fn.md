Montgomery County - Board of Education - Student Member Compensation  
MC 7-25 
 
 
This bill alters compensation procedures for the student member of the 
Montgomery County Board of Education. Although the bill does not alter compensation 
amounts for elected members, the bill specifies that future salary increases for elected 
members must take effect at the beginning of the term of office (and may not increase 
during the term of office). The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None. 
 
Local Effect:  The bill has no material effect on Montgomery County Board of Education 
expenditures as the bill does not alter total compensation amounts, only the timing and 
form of compensation. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill allows the student member of the Montgomery County Board of 
Education to elect to receive compensation in monthly installments as a stipend during the 
student member’s term and receive any remaining amount as a scholarship after the end of 
the term. Under the bill, total compensation amount must remain equal to the lesser of 
(1) the highest annual resident undergraduate tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board 
that is charged at specified four-year public institutions of higher education within the 
University System of Maryland (USM) for the academic year in which the student member

serves on the board and (2) the amount that an elected member of the board (other than the 
board president) is entitled to receive as compensation in that year. The bill also repeals 
language requiring the student member to submit expense vouchers before the student 
member may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with official 
duties (but retains the reimbursement authorization). 
 
Current Law:  The Montgomery County Board of Education consists of seven elected 
members and one student member. Elected members serve four-year terms beginning 
December 1 after the member’s election and until a successor is qualified; the student 
member serves a one-year term beginning on July 1 after the election of the student 
member. The board is 1 of 20 elected school boards in the State. There are 4 hybrid boards 
in the State. The Appendix – Local Boards of Education Membership shows the 
selection methods, terms of office, and membership of the 24 local boards of education. 
 
Student Member Scholarship  
 
The student member may not receive compensation, but after submitting expense vouchers, 
may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with official duties. 
Chapter 566 of 2022 set the student member scholarship amount to be the lesser of (1) the 
highest annual resident undergraduate tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board that is 
charged at specified four-year public institutions of higher education within USM for the 
academic year in which the student member serves on the board and (2) the amount that an 
elected member of the board (other than the board president) is entitled to receive as 
compensation in that year. 
 
In fiscal 2025, the University of Maryland, College Park Campus (UMCP) had the highest 
tuition, fees, and room and board among specified USM institutions. Annual resident 
tuition, fees, average board costs, and costs for a standard double room totaled $27,408 at 
UMCP. As this amount is higher than the $25,000 in compensation for an elected board 
member set in current law, the student scholarship amount is currently held at $25,000.

Appendix – Local Boards of Education Membership 
 
 
The composition of the local boards of education varies with members serving three- to 
four-year terms. Twenty counties have elected school boards and four counties have 
combined appointed and elected school boards. Twenty-two boards have student members; 
however, only 8 boards allow student members to vote, which generally excludes authority 
to vote on matters relating to collective bargaining and personnel. Three counties with 
voting student members also preclude student members from voting on matters relating to 
operating and capital budgets. Exhibit 1 shows the selection methods, terms of office, and 
membership of the 24 local school boards.
