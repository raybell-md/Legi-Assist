Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  For properties located in Montgomery County only, the bill requires the 
county councils to grant a full or partial exemption from the system development charge 
for (1) revitalization projects; (2) property used by specified community-based 
organizations providing recreational and educational programs and services to youth; 
(3) property used primarily for child care or after-school care; or (4) property used 
primarily for programs and services for developmentally disabled individuals. 
 
Under definitions set forth by the county councils, the bill requires the county councils to 
grant, in Montgomery County only, a full or partial exemption from the system 
development charge for (1) residential property located in a planned retirement community 
as defined in the zoning ordinance of Montgomery County; (2) elderly housing not 
included in the preceding zoning ordinance; or (3) properties used for manufacturing or 
biotechnology research and development.  
 
By October 1 each year, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties must report to their 
respective delegations the total number of exemptions received and granted, as well as the 
total dollar amount of exemptions granted, for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The 
counties must also report (1) the process used to identify publicly sponsored and affordable 
housing projects; (2) the number of publicly sponsored and affordable housing projects 
granted exemptions; and (3) the number of publicly sponsored or affordable housing units 
included in each project. 
 
Current Law:  State law provides for several exemptions to the WSSC system 
development charge. A full or partial exemption must be granted for public-sponsored or 
affordable housing as jointly defined and agreed upon by the county councils. In addition, 
a full or partial exemption may be granted for (1) revitalization projects; (2) property 
owned by specified community-based organizations providing recreational and educational 
programs and services to youth; (3) property used primarily for child care or after-school 
care; or (4) property used primarily for programs and services for developmentally disabled 
individuals.  
 
Under conditions set forth by the county councils, the county councils may grant a full or 
partial exemption for (1) residential property located in a mixed retirement development as 
defined in the zoning ordinance of Prince George’s County; (2) residential property located 
in a planned retirement community as defined in the zoning ordinance of 
Montgomery County; (3) other elderly housing; and (4) properties used for biotechnology 
research and development or manufacturing.  
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The system development charge is imposed on new development as 
a method to pay for capital expenses needed to accommodate growth in the bicounty area.

HB 1230/ Page 3 
It is reviewed and updated annually by the county councils. The county councils have 
established a $500,000 per county annual limit on exemptions to the system development 
charge, with any unused portion allowed to carry over to future years indefinitely. This 
restriction first became effective in fiscal 1999. Through fiscal 2024, Montgomery County 
has granted $3.9 million in exemptions, and Prince George’s County has granted 
$9.7 million. Both jurisdictions have the capacity to grant additional exemptions from the 
system development charge without exceeding the current limitations.  
 
Exhibit 1 shows the amount of exemptions granted in each county and the amount that has 
been carried over to future years. Exhibits 2 and 3 show the amount of exemptions granted 
by category for each year since fiscal 1999.
