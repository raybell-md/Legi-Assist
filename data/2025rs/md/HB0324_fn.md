County Boards of Education - Antibias Training for Members - Requirement 
(County Board Member Antibias Training Act) 
 
 
This bill requires each member of a local board of education to complete an antibias 
training program at least once during their term. The training program must be the same as 
provided to public school employees; however, the antibias training for board members 
must be conducted separately from the training provided to public school employees. This 
bill takes effect July 1, 2025.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None.  
  
Local Effect:  Local school systems can comply with the bill’s requirements with existing 
resources.  
 
Small Business Effect:  None.  
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 128 of 2024 requires local school systems to provide antibias 
training to certain school employees based on guidelines developed by the Maryland State 
Department of Education (MSDE).  
 
Antibias Guidelines 
 
MSDE is required to develop guidelines for an antibias training program for school 
employees. The guidelines developed must include specified elements, including

HB 324/ Page 2 
(1) raising awareness of biases, prejudices, intolerances, and discrimination faced by 
African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 
Hispanic Americans, and other historically marginalized racial and ethnic minorities and 
(2) combating prejudices faced by historically marginalized religious minorities, including 
antisemitism and Islamophobia. In developing the guidelines, MSDE must incorporate 
lessons learned from real-life incidents of discriminatory bullying, harassment, or 
intimidation reported in accordance with the bullying, harassment, or intimidation policies 
required by law. MSDE periodically must update the guidelines.  
 
Public School Antibias Training 
 
Each local board of education must, in consultation with teachers and other public school 
employees, develop an antibias training based on the guidelines developed by MSDE. 
Every other year, each local board of education must train each public school employee 
whose job duties include frequent interactions with students using its antibias training.  
 
Antibias training must be job-embedded, paid professional development training that is 
provided during nonteaching time. To the extent practicable, the training must (1) be 
offered in a peer-to-peer setting; (2) take a half day or less to complete; and (3) incorporate 
lessons learned from incidents of bullying, harassment, or intimidation in the county, as 
reported.

Appendix – Local Boards of Education Membership 
 
 
The composition of the local boards of education varies with members serving three- to 
four-year terms. Twenty counties have elected school boards and four counties have 
combined appointed and elected school boards. 22 boards have student members; however, 
only 8 boards allow student members to vote, which generally excludes authority to vote 
on matters relating to collective bargaining and personnel. Three counties with voting 
student members also preclude student members from voting on matters relating to 
operating and capital budgets. Exhibit 1 shows the selection methods, terms of office, and 
membership of the 24 local school boards.
