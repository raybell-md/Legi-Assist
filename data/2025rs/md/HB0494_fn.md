Maryland Code, primarily by reference to definitions in the U.S. Code. While numerous

changes. The changes primarily clarify and/or expand the availability of service member 
and veteran benefits and privileges to certain additional service members and veterans.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  The bill adds the definition of several military terms to 
(1) the State Government Article (specifically, § 9-901, applicable to Title 9, Subtitle 9, 
“Department of Veterans and Military Families”); (2) the Natural Resources Article 
(specifically, § 1-106 by reference to State Government § 9-901 – applicable throughout 
the Natural Resources Article); and (3) definitions under Title 1 (“Rules of Interpretation”) 
of the General Provisions Article (by reference to State Government § 9-901) that apply in 
the Maryland Code if not otherwise specified. This includes the definition of “military 
family” (only added to State Government § 9-901) as well as all terms found in Exhibit 1 
below. “Military family” includes the spouse and dependent children of a service member 
or veteran related by blood, marriage, or adoption.

Recreational Benefits and Privileges for Service Members and Veterans 
 
Through addition of definitions (shown in Exhibit 1) applicable throughout the  
Natural Resources Article and certain other changes to provisions in the article, the bill 
clarifies and/or expands the availability of (primarily) recreational benefits and privileges 
for service members and veterans, including the following: 
 
 
Healing Hunting and Fishing Fund – provides grants to organizations providing 
recreational hunting, fishing, and other outdoor opportunities to service members, 
veterans, and Gold Star recipients; 
 
 
Governmental entity or nonprofit organization fishing license exemption – allows a 
governmental entity or nonprofit organization to take disabled service members and 
veterans fishing, or provide fishing clinics and instructional opportunities to service 
members and veterans, without the service members and veterans needing a 
recreational fishing license; 
 
 
Fishing license does not lapse because of deployment – ensures a fishing license 
does not lapse if a licensee fails to renew or make use of the license because of 
deployment (this appears to apply primarily to a commercial license); 
 
 
License exemptions for active service members on leave – allow resident active 
service (or, in certain cases, only armed forces) members on leave to fish 
recreationally and hunt without a license; 
 
 
Hunting license exemption for armed forces member with service-connected 
disability and former member of the armed forces hunting on farmland – allows a 
person serving in the armed forces who has a service-connected disability to hunt 
without a hunting license and allows a retired former member of the armed forces 
to hunt on active farmland owned by the person or person’s family without a license; 
 
 
Complimentary licenses for certain veterans – provide complimentary recreational 
fishing and hunting licenses to (1) former prisoners of war; (2) American veterans 
determined to be unemployable; and (3) 100% service-connected disabled 
American veterans; 
 
 
Required plan to increase engagement of veterans – requires the Department of 
Natural Resources, in consultation with staff of the Wildlife Conservation, 
Education, and Outreach Program, to develop a plan to increase engagement of 
communities that historically have not had access to hunting and conservation

programs, and engagement of veterans, in (1) outdoor recreation and stewardship; 
(2) hunting; and (3) wildlife conservation; and  
 
 
Free entry to State parks for service members and veterans – newly established in 
law by the bill (codifying current practice of the Maryland Park Service and 
expanding its availability primarily to current and former commissioned officers of 
the Public Health Service (PHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA)), allows an active service member, any member of the 
Maryland National Guard, or a veteran to enter a State park without paying a day-
use entry fee or any per-vehicle fee.  
 
State Fiscal Effect:  Although the changes in the bill expand the availability of certain 
benefits and privileges for service members and veterans, primarily to current and former 
commissioned officers in PHS and NOAA (in cases in which they are not already eligible 
under current law), that expansion is not expected to have a material fiscal impact. In 
January 2020, the latest date for which information is readily available, there were an 
estimated 2,200 PHS officers living in Maryland, with about 1,500 on active duty and 
700 retired. As of September 2024, there are 53 NOAA officers in the State. 
 
Additional Comments:  Under additional definitions under 38 U.S.C. § 101, “active 
military, naval, air, or space service” includes full-time duty in a reserve component of the 
armed forces, full-time duty as a commissioned officer of the Regular or Reserve Corps of 
PHS or commissioned officer corps of NOAA, and service as a cadet or midshipman at a 
service academy (Military, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Naval academies).
