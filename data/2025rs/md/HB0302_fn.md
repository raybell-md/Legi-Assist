Current Law:  An application for a statement of charges for an offense allegedly 
committed in the course of executing the duties of a law enforcement officer, emergency 
services personnel, or an educator may not be filed against such a professional until the 
State’s Attorney has investigated the circumstances of the matter and made 
recommendations to the District Court Commissioner. 
 
An application filed in the District Court requesting that a statement of charges be filed 
against a law enforcement officer, emergency services personnel, or an educator for an 
offense allegedly committed in the course of executing the duties of the individual must 
immediately be forwarded to the State’s Attorney. Upon receipt, the State’s Attorney must  
(1) investigate the circumstances of the matter and (2) make a recommendation to the 
District Court Commissioner as to whether a statement of charges should be filed against 
the individual (if applicable, including whether a summons or warrant should be issued). 
 
The State’s Attorney is not precluded from making a determination that an information 
should be filed against a law enforcement officer, emergency services personnel, or an 
educator or that a grand jury should be convened to determine whether an indictment 
should be filed.
