Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Affiliated Foundations  
 
The bill authorizes DNR to establish one or more affiliated foundations to work with the 
Maryland Park Service, the Maryland Forest Service, the Wildlife and Heritage Service, 
the Office of Outdoor Recreation, and the Natural Resources Police, and establishes 
various provisions governing the foundations, which:   
 
 
purposes – establish the purposes of an affiliated foundation to be (1) soliciting and 
accepting funds for improvements designed to expand and enhance the equitable 
use of and access to lands managed by the department for recreation and 
conservation purposes; (2) promoting activities that enhance public programming 
and offerings, restore or maintain public access to natural resources, or support 
operation, maintenance, and law enforcement activities within DNR-managed 
lands; and (3) partnering with individuals, corporations, and other entities to support 
innovative projects that enhance visitors’ experiences; 
 
 
policies – require DNR to develop policies for operating each affiliated foundation, 
including naming rights, that must be submitted to the Attorney General and the 
State Ethics Commission for review and, if appropriate, approval;  
 
 
solicitation and receipt of contributions – authorize an affiliated foundation to 
solicit and receive contributions from businesses, governmental entities, nonprofit 
organizations, and individuals interested in the promotion of DNR-managed lands; 
 
 
not an agency or instrumentality of the State – establish that (1) an affiliated 
foundation may not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the State or a unit 
of the Executive Branch for any purpose and (2) a financial obligation or liability of 
an affiliated foundation may not be considered a debt or an obligation of the State 
or DNR; 
 
 
DNR officials/employees may serve as foundation directors/officials – establish 
that conflict of interest provisions of the Maryland Public Ethics Law do not prohibit 
a DNR official or employee from also becoming a director or official of an affiliated 
foundation provided that (1) the State Ethics Commission must be notified and may 
raise objections or concerns and (2) such an official or employee may not be 
compensated by the affiliated foundation but may be reimbursed for expenses;  
 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 717/ Page 3 
 
reporting – require DNR to report annually to the Governor, the Legislative Policy 
Committee, and the State Ethics Commission on (1) the names of the officials and 
employees serving as a director or an official of an affiliated foundation and (2) how 
the policies for operating each affiliated foundation have been implemented in the 
previous year; 
 
 
audit – require that an affiliated foundation be audited each year by an independent 
certified public accountant; and 
 
 
funds are supplemental – establish that funds accepted by an affiliated foundation 
are supplemental to and are not intended to take the place of funding that otherwise 
would be provided in the annual State operating or capital budget bill for projects 
or activities of DNR. 
 
Use of Program Open Space Funding for Operating Costs  
 
The bill authorizes the Governor to transfer, to DNR, funds from the POS State land 
acquisition balance if (1) the balance is more than $80.0 million at the end of a given 
fiscal year and (2) DNR’s existing special fund sources are insufficient to cover existing 
salaries for permanent, classified positions responsible for operating and maintaining land 
administered and managed by the department. After such a fund transfer, the remaining 
balance must be at least $80.0 million. 
 
DNR may use any amount of the transferred funds as a one-time fiscal year expenditure 
for (1) operation and maintenance of lands administered and managed by the department; 
(2) administrative expenses related to land acquired by the department under POS; or  
(3) law enforcement activities, services, salaries, and related expenses of the 
Natural Resources Police. DNR may also transfer any amount of the transferred funds to 
the Forest or Park Reserve Fund. Any fund transfer supplements rather than supplants any 
other funding for operation, maintenance, and administration of lands administered and 
managed by DNR regardless of the source of the other funding. 
 
Budget Requests for Positions to Manage and Administer New Real Property  
 
The bill requires DNR, after acquiring a fee simple real property interest, to include in its 
annual budget request to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) a request for 
funds to create new permanent, classified positions to manage and administer the fee 
simple interest. The request must be based on specified data and calculated using the ratio 
of at least one permanent, classified position per 400 acres of newly acquired fee simple 
interests.

HB 717/ Page 4 
Other Provisions Governing the Department’s Acquisition of Real Property  
 
Under existing provisions governing the department’s acquisition of real property, 
references to “land” and “real property” are changed to references to a “real property 
interest.” The bill defines “real property interest” to mean a nonleasehold interest in real 
property, including a fee simple acquisition interest, conservation easement interest, or 
another perpetual easement interest. 
 
The bill also (1) authorizes DNR, with approval of the Board of Public Works (BPW), to 
develop and utilize an easement valuation system to value conservation easement interests; 
(2) establishes that a requirement that a contract for the acquisition of a real property 
interest be approved by BPW does not apply to a real property interest acquired by gift;  
(3) changes a requirement that a contract for acquisition be executed by BPW to an 
authorization for a contract to be executed by BPW; and (4) prohibits DNR from disposing 
of a conservation easement interest under existing provisions that allow the department to 
dispose of land (under the bill, a real property interest) owned and managed by the 
department as consideration for the acquisition of land (under the bill, a real property 
interest) not owned by the department.  
 
Land and Property Management Program  
 
The bill establishes a Land and Property Management Program in DNR, the stated purpose 
of which is to process real property transactions that involve property owned by the 
department. The program is responsible for (1) processing lease agreements, easements, 
and other property-related documents and (2) facilitating issuing leases for department 
housing to department employees in accordance with the department’s residential housing 
policy. 
 
Local Use of Program Open Space Funding 
 
 
Portion of Funding Used for Development and Capital Renewal  
 
The bill increases the extent to which counties, other than Baltimore City and Garrett and 
Allegany counties, that have met land acquisition goals in their current, approved local land 
preservation and recreation plan, can use POS local funding for development projects. The 
bill (1) allows those counties to use up to 100%, instead of up to 75%, of their POS local 
funding for development projects; (2) eliminates a requirement that the counties’ acreage 
attainment goals equal or exceed the minimum recommended acreage goals developed for 
the jurisdiction under the Maryland Land Preservation and Recreation Plan (the bill also 
eliminates a similar requirement for Garrett and Allegany counties); and (3) eliminates a 
provision that limits the duration of the authorization to use the increased percentage of 
funding for development projects to a period of five years. These changes apply to a 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 717/ Page 5 
county’s (1) POS local funding apportionment that is not yet encumbered as of  
July 1, 2025; (2) fiscal 2026 apportionment; and (3) future annual apportionments. 
 
The bill does not affect Baltimore City’s and Garrett and Allegany counties’ ability to use 
POS local funding for development projects because (1) Baltimore City is separately 
authorized under current law to use any portion of its POS local funding for either 
acquisition or development and (2) Garrett and Allegany counties already have the ability 
under current law to use up to 100% of their funding for development projects under a 
provision that applies to jurisdictions with more than 65,000 acres of land consisting of 
State forests, State parks, or wildlife management areas. 
 
The bill removes express authorization in statute for the counties (apart from 
Baltimore City) to use POS local funding for capital renewal by (1) removing an 
authorization for counties other than Allegany and Garrett counties to use up to 20% of 
funds authorized for use for development projects, for capital renewal, and (2) replacing 
the authorization for Allegany and Garrett counties to use up to 100% of their POS local 
funding for development projects and capital renewal with the broader authorization 
(applicable to all counties apart from Baltimore City) for counties to use up to 100% of 
their POS local funding for development projects. “Capital renewal” is defined under 
current law as renewal of a capital project for which an improvement is necessary to ensure 
the physical integrity of (1) a facility; (2) fixed equipment; or (3) an existing physical 
improvement. (See also Additional Comments, below, regarding this change.) 
 
 
Local Matching Funding for Development Projects  
 
The bill modifies existing provisions (described under Current Law/Background) that 
determine the amount of the total cost of a development project that can be covered by POS 
local funds and the amount that must be covered by the county (local matching funds). The 
bill modifies those provisions so that, if State funds (other than POS local funds) or federal 
funds are provided on any development project cost, the local matching funding is equal to 
a percentage of the POS local funds amount rather than a percentage of the total project 
cost. The modified provisions establish that if State funds (other than POS local funds) or 
federal funds are provided for a development project – and provided that total State funds 
when added to other available funds do not exceed 100% of the total project cost – the local 
jurisdiction must match (1) 25% of the POS local funds amount or (2) if the jurisdiction’s 
acquisition goals have been met, 10% of the POS local funds amount.  
 
 
Use of Acquisition Funds for Plan Updates  
 
The bill modifies an existing authorization for a county to use up to $25,000 per fiscal year, 
of POS local land acquisition funding, to update its local land preservation and recreation 
plan. The bill modifies the authorization so that a county may instead use up to 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 717/ Page 6 
$125,000 for any individual plan update within the five-year land preservation and 
recreation plan update cycle. 
 
Current Law/Background:   
 
Affiliated Foundations 
 
DNR indicates that the creation of one or more affiliated foundations (1) utilizes the 
department’s ability to access a variety of user groups and constituents to help support the 
department’s efforts to conserve and provide access to public lands and (2) allows the 
department to form more formal partnerships with corporate and nonprofit partners. DNR 
indicates that the National Park Foundation, the official charitable arm of the National Park 
Service, is an example of this approach to public lands management. 
 
The conflict-of-interest provisions of the Maryland Public Ethics law – which the bill 
establishes do not prohibit DNR officials or employees from also becoming a director or 
an official of an affiliated foundation – establish prohibitions and requirements that 
primarily guard against the potential for a government official’s or employee’s personal 
financial interests or outside employment to influence their actions as a governmental 
official or employee. 
 
While not specifically identified by DNR, these provisions of the bill appear broadly 
consistent with funding recommendations in the Maryland State Park System Study and 
Recommendations (2024) (see pp. 178-179), completed pursuant to Chapter 39 of 2022, 
(the Great Maryland Outdoors Act), relating to public-private partnerships, corporate 
sponsorships, and establishment of a nonprofit organization to support the State’s park 
system. 
 
Use of Program Open Space Funding for Operating Costs  
 
The State transfer tax, which is 0.5% of the amount paid for the transfer of real property, 
is used to fund POS, along with several land conservation programs and State forest and 
park operations. DNR administers POS, which acquires and improves outdoor recreation 
and open space areas for public use. POS consists of a State and local component. 
Approximately 50% of the transfer tax funding distributed to POS is allocated to State land 
acquisition and capital development, 30% is allocated to local government acquisition and 
development, and 20% is allocated to State forest and park operations. 
 
The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2025 (BRFA) (House Bill 352), as passed 
by the General Assembly, authorizes the Governor to appropriate to DNR up to 
$16.4 million from POS State land acquisition fund balance for operating expenses in the 
Maryland Park Service in fiscal 2026 only. DNR indicates that the POS State land 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 717/ Page 7 
acquisition unencumbered fund balance is approximately $125.0 million as of the end of 
April 2025 and, in addition to the $16.4 million authorized under the BRFA to be 
appropriated in fiscal 2026, a total of approximately $7.0 million of acquisition projects is 
scheduled for BPW approval in May and June 2025. However, given that additional 
projects are likely encumbered before the end of fiscal 2026, it is difficult to project the 
POS State land acquisition fund balance at the end of fiscal 2026. But DNR expects, under 
the bill, to make such a projection in fall 2025, during the fiscal 2027 budget process, to 
determine the extent of any transfer of POS State land acquisition fund balance to cover 
operating costs in fiscal 2027.  
 
DNR indicates that this bill (1) provides ongoing authority for use of POS State land 
acquisition fund balance for operating expenses similar in manner to the BRFA’s 
authorization applicable to fiscal 2026 only and (2) allows the department to both continue 
to acquire land to achieve State land conservation goals and have sufficient operating 
funding to manage existing and newly acquired State lands. 
 
DLS notes that DNR considers transfer tax funding appropriated to the Heritage 
Conservation Fund under § 13-209 of the Tax-Property Article, that has not yet been spent, 
to be a part of the POS State land acquisition fund balance. (Section 13-209 allocates 
transfer tax funding among POS and other land conservation programs, including the 
Heritage Conservation Fund.) DNR indicates that a portion (less than 10%) of the 
above-referenced POS State land acquisition unencumbered fund balance ($125.0 million) 
is Heritage Conservation Fund funding. Program Open Space and the Heritage 
Conservation Fund have similar purposes and are both funded by transfer tax funding but 
are separately established in statute, and it appears unclear whether, under the bill, 
“Program Open Space State land acquisition balance” is intended to include Heritage 
Conservation Fund funding.  
 
Budget Requests for Positions to Manage and Administer New Real Property 
 
DNR indicates that since 2003, acreage under active management by the department has 
increased from approximately 350,000 acres to more than 500,000 acres, while the number 
of authorized positions within the land management units in DNR, prior to fiscal 2024, had 
decreased during that time period. Chapter 39 (the Great Maryland Outdoors Act) provided 
a one-time influx of positions in fiscal 2024 that returned the department’s land 
management units to 2003 staffing levels, but with the growth in acreage of DNR’s lands 
since 2003, the department continues to need additional land management staff. 
 
DNR indicates that the bill’s provision requiring the department to make a budget request 
for new positions to manage newly acquired fee simple real property interests at a rate of 
one new position per 400 acres of newly-acquired fee simple interests is based on a 
recommendation in the Maryland State Park System Study and Recommendations (2024) 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
HB 717/ Page 8 
(see pp. 55 and 57) that DNR’s Maryland Park Service staff to visitors and acreage ratio 
be returned to the ratio in 2003 of one staff per 33,585 visitors and per 401 acres. 
 
Provisions Governing the Department’s Acquisition of Real Property 
 
DNR’s acquisition and transfer of land is subject to specified provisions under the 
Natural Resources Article, which, among other things, require the department to negotiate 
the acquisition of real property for open space, recreation, conservation, and other purposes 
under the article, with each acquisition made in the name of the State to the use of the 
department. 
 
Under current law, except for real property acquired by gift, DNR must obtain 
two independent appraisals of real property acquired from a private owner, and a contract 
for the acquisition of land must be approved and executed by BPW. 
 
DNR is authorized to dispose of land owned and managed by the department as 
consideration for the acquisition of land not owned by the department, including the 
exchange of real property of up to five acres for adjacent real property without complying 
with specified procedures applicable to transfers of State property.  
 
DNR generally indicates that the bill’s changes to these provisions reflect current practice, 
including (1) referring to “real property interests” to clarify that a land acquisition may 
include perpetual easement interests as well as fee simple interests; (2) authorizing in 
statute the use of an easement valuation system, which BPW has approved DNR’s use of 
in place of two independent appraisals; and (3) allowing other entities to hold 
title/easements with BPW approval. 
 
Land and Property Management Program 
 
DNR indicates that the bill codifies the Land and Property Management Program which 
was recently established in the department’s Land Acquisition and Planning Unit to  
(1) oversee and process real property transactions for the department and (2) implement a 
newly created DNR housing policy which governs leasing of the department’s operational 
houses to employees and eliminates individual managers’ authority over leasing decisions. 
 
Local Program Open Space Funding  
 
As referenced above, approximately 30% of transfer tax funding distributed to POS is 
allocated to local government land acquisition and development. The funding is allocated 
among the counties through an apportionment formula. 
 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 717/ Page 9 
 
Portion of Funding Used for Development and Capital Renewal 
 
A county must prepare (and revise, every five years) a local land preservation and 
recreation plan with acquisition goals to be approved by DNR and the 
Maryland Department of Planning (MDP). With the exception of Baltimore City and 
Garrett and Allegany counties, at least one half of a county’s annual apportionment of POS 
funding must be used for acquisition, with the other half available for acquisition or 
development (20% of which may be used for capital renewal), unless DNR and MDP 
certify that the county’s acquisition goals have been met (and those goals equal or exceed 
goals developed for the jurisdiction under the Maryland Land Preservation and Recreation 
Plan), in which case a county may use up to 75% of its future annual apportionment for 
development projects for a period of five years (20% of which may be used for capital 
renewal). In Baltimore City, any portion of the city’s annual apportionment may be used 
either for acquisition or development. In addition, a county that has more than 65,000 acres 
of land consisting of State forests, State parks, or wildlife management areas (Garrett and 
Allegany counties), and has exceeded its acquisition goals (and the minimum 
recommended acreage goals developed for the jurisdiction under the Maryland Land 
Preservation and Recreation Plan), may use up to 100% of its future annual apportionment 
for development projects and capital renewal.  
 
DNR indicates that the bill’s authorization for all counties to use up to 100% of their 
funding for development if acquisition goals are met gives the counties additional 
flexibility while maintaining a focus on acquisition goals. The bill’s repeal of the 
requirement that counties’ goals, or acreage attainment, equal or exceed goals for the 
county under the Maryland Land Preservation and Recreation Plan reflects the fact that the 
plan does not include minimum goals for counties. See the Additional Comments, below, 
regarding the bill’s changes affecting the use of POS local funding for capital renewal and 
DNR’s perspective on such use. 
 
 
Local Matching Funding for Development Projects 
 
POS local funds may be used by a county for 100% of the cost of land acquisition projects, 
less the amount of any federal funds provided for the acquisition.  
 
For development projects, if federal funds cover less than 50% of the total project cost, 
funding from the State (POS local funds) must cover the difference between any 
federal funds provided and 75% of the total project cost (including the full 75% if there is 
no federal funding), with the remaining share of the project cost being the responsibility of 
the county. If the county has met its acquisition goals, POS local funds must cover the 
difference between any federal funds provided and 90% of the total project cost. If 
federal funds cover 50% or more of the total project cost, statute provides for POS local 
funds to cover at least 50% of the difference between the federal funds and the total project

HB 717/ Page 10 
cost, if not more, since the minimum POS local funds contribution to a project must be 
25%, provided the funds, when added to other available funds, do not exceed 100% of the 
total project cost.  
 
 
Use of Acquisition Funds for Plan Updates 
 
Subject to DNR’s approval, a county may use up to $25,000 per fiscal year, of its 
acquisition funds, to update its local land preservation and recreation plan. Local matching 
funds are not required.

1 This amount includes a $10.0 million direct grant to Baltimore City from POS State funding required by statute. It 
does not include an additional $1.6 million included in the fiscal 2026 budget for Baltimore City park projects because 
that amount represents reallocation of previously appropriated POS State direct grant funding to the city.  
2 The acquisition goals are shown as not applicable to Baltimore City because, unlike other jurisdictions, statute does 
not condition the extent to which Baltimore City can use POS local funding for development projects (instead of land 
acquisition) on whether the city has met its acquisition goals. However, DNR indicates that the city has met its current 
acquisition goals, according to the city’s most recent land preservation and recreation plan.

As summarized in Exhibit 2, the bill has the following effects on State finances:   
 
 
Land and Property Management Program – Special fund expenditures increase 
by $212,543 in fiscal 2026 and by ongoing amounts in future years, reflecting the 
cost of two additional positions in the Land and Property Management Program. 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $212,543 in 
special funds and two merit positions contingent on the enactment of legislation 
allowing DNR to realign POS State land acquisition fund balance to support 
operating expenses under certain circumstances. DNR and DBM indicate that  
(1) the two additional positions for the program (which has four existing positions) 
are needed to help manage the program’s workload as DNR continues to acquire 
land and (2) the bill’s allowance for the use of POS State land acquisition fund 
balance for operating costs helps ensure there is funding for the two positions in 

END OF PAGE 12

START OF PAGE 13
    
HB 717/ Page 13 
future years. Future year expenditures reflect salaries with annual increases and 
employee turnover as well as annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. 
 
 
Budget Requests for Positions – Special fund expenditures increase by $378,696 
in fiscal 2027 and greater amounts in future years, reflecting hiring of additional 
DNR staff in accordance with budget requests made pursuant to the bill for 
new staff, at a rate of one new position for every 400 newly acquired acres of fee 
simple real property interests. This estimate assumes (1) budget requests made by 
DNR pursuant to the bill are approved and result in hiring of requested staff in the 
following fiscal year; (2) at least four additional staff are hired each fiscal year, 
beginning in fiscal 2027, based on the required ratio of one additional position 
per 400 acres of newly acquired fee simple interests and the average annual increase 
in DNR (fee simple) land acreage (1,751 acres) between fiscal 2019 and 2024; and  
(3) the cost of the additional positions is covered, if no other special funds (DNR’s 
predominant source of funding) are available, by transferred POS State land 
acquisition fund balance as allowed by the bill. Future year expenditures reflect 
salaries with annual increases and employee turnover as well as annual increases in 
ongoing operating expenses. 
 
 
Any Additional Use of Program Open Space Funds for Operating Costs – 
While the bill’s allowance for the use of POS State land acquisition fund balance 
for operating costs is assumed to cover the two additional positions under the 
Land and Property Management Program and the new positions resulting from 
budget requests, pursuant to the bill, presumably special fund expenditures may 
further increase in fiscal 2027 and future years due to the use of POS State land 
acquisition fund balance for additional operating costs described in the bill; 
however, the extent of any such additional increase in special fund expenditures 
cannot be reliably estimated. (DLS notes that these increases in special fund 
expenditures (to cover the Land and Property Management Program positions, 
new positions resulting from the bill’s budget request requirement, and any other 
operating costs) may, to an extent, reflect spending of fund balance that is spent, 
even in the absence of the bill, but in a later fiscal year for land acquisition; however, 
it is difficult to determine how much of any increased spending occurs even in the 
absence of the bill in later years, and how much may represent spending of funds 
that, in the absence of the bill, are maintained as fund balance year after year, 
without being spent in the immediate foreseeable future.) 
 
This analysis assumes that the bill’s authorization for DNR to establish one or more 
affiliated foundations does not directly affect State finances, since, under the bill, (1) a 
foundation may not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the State or a unit of the 
Executive Branch for any purpose and (2) a financial obligation or liability of an affiliated 
foundation may not be considered a debt or an obligation of the State or DNR. It is assumed

that the foundation’s (or foundations’) finances are maintained separately from DNR’s 
finances, as non-State funds. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The bill does not change the amount of POS local funding allocated 
to the counties overall or individually; however, counties may benefit from (1) the ability 
to use a greater portion of their POS local funding for parks and recreation development 
projects, if they have met their land acquisition goals, and (2) the ability to seek approval 
from DNR to use up to $125,000 of acquisition funds to update their local land preservation 
and recreation plans for each five-year plan update cycle without having to seek approval 
for funding in multiple years under the current $25,000 per fiscal year limit.  
 
Counties may also benefit from the bill’s change to the local matching funds calculation 
for POS local-funded parks and recreation development projects (when federal or other 
State funds are also used for the project). The calculation under the bill appears to reduce 
the amount of local matching funds a county must provide per project, for those projects 
where federal or other State funds are used, allowing a county to spend more of its POS 
local funds per project under the bill than under current law; though, as mentioned above, 
the bill does not change the amount of POS local funding allocated to the counties overall 
or individually. The Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) and the Maryland 
Association of County Park and Recreation Administrators (an affiliate of MACo) also 
indicate that the change reduces counties’ administrative burden by simplifying the process 
of determining the local matching funding requirement for a project. 
 
Small Business Effect:  DLS disagrees with DNR’s assessment that the bill has no 
economic impact on small businesses. The bill may have a meaningful positive impact on 
small businesses involved in any development or activities funded by affiliated foundations 
or that result from local governments’ increased ability to use POS local funding for 
development projects. The bill may also negatively impact small businesses that provide 
services associated with land acquisition (e.g., title work, surveys, and appraisals) to the 
extent the bill reduces State and/or local land acquisition to any extent, now or in the future. 
 
Additional Comments:  As mentioned in the Bill Summary, the bill removes express 
authorization in statute for the counties (apart from Baltimore City) to use POS local 
funding for capital renewal. However, DNR considers the terms “development” and 
“development projects” to include capital renewal projects and indicates that the bill is not 
intended to remove counties’ ability to use funding for capital renewal.  
 
Statute does not currently expressly authorize Baltimore City to use its POS local funding 
for capital renewal but DNR has considered the existing authorization for the city to use 
funding for “development” to include capital renewal.
