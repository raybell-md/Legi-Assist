specified. 
 
Requires the Prince George’s County Board of Education to use a competitive

to conduct nursing home surveys and complaint investigations to the county if MDH 
failed to comply with specified survey requirements in fiscal 2023 and 2024, along 
with other specified requirements. 
 
Current Law:  The Maryland Constitution requires the Governor to submit, and the 
General Assembly to pass, a balanced budget. General funds cannot be used to restore 
reductions made by the General Assembly after adoption of the budget, except through an 
approved deficiency appropriation in the following year’s budget. 
 
Beginning with the 2023 session (fiscal 2024 budget bill), the General Assembly may 
amend the budget to increase appropriations made by the Governor as well as add items to 
appropriations for Executive Branch agencies if the total appropriation for the 
Executive Branch does not exceed the total proposed appropriation submitted by the 
Governor. Prior to the 2023 session, the legislature could only add or increase funding for 
the General Assembly and the Judiciary.

HB 352/ Page 14 
Background:  In December 2024, the Spending Affordability Committee recommended 
that the fiscal 2026 budget leave a closing general fund balance of at least $100.0 million. 
The committee also recommended maintaining a Rainy Day Fund balance of at least 
7.5% of estimated general fund revenues. A structural deficit of $2.5 billion was forecasted 
for fiscal 2026 and was projected to increase to $6.0 billion by fiscal 2030, so the committee 
recommended that the fiscal 2026 budget erase the projected $2.5 billion gap between 
ongoing general fund revenues and ongoing spending in fiscal 2026 and improve the 
outlook for fiscal 2028 so that ongoing revenues will support at least 94% of projected 
ongoing spending. 
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as introduced would have left a $106.0 million balance in the 
general fund and maintained the Rainy Day Fund balance at 8% of general fund revenues 
($2.1 billion). However, ongoing spending in the fiscal 2026 budget as introduced 
exceeded ongoing revenues by $186.0 million, falling short of the Spending Affordability 
Committee’s goal of eliminating the projected $2.5 billion structural deficit. While the 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly reduces the projected structural 
deficit throughout the forecast period (through fiscal 2030), a significant structural gap still 
remains in the out-years. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  Estimates of the fiscal 2025 and 2026 impact of the bill on the State 
general fund, totaling almost $3.4 billion, are shown in Exhibit 1.

A discussion of each provision in the bill is provided in Appendix A (beginning on 
page 18). The fiscal 2025 through 2030 State effects for each provision, including the 
general fund impacts, the effects on other fund types, and other related information, such 
as any effects on local governments, are included with the discussions. Appendix B 
(beginning on page 232) identifies the quantified fiscal impact of separate provisions by 
budgeted fund type. 
 
This analysis assumes that increased TTF revenues from the bill’s provisions, totaling 
$481.7 million in fiscal 2026, are largely directed toward MDOT’s operating spending 
needs and, thus, do not have a material impact on increasing MDOT’s bond capacity. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The impacts on local jurisdictions are included in the discussion of 
each provision in Appendix A. For example, the local share of the cost of educating a child 
with disabilities in a nonpublic placement program increases by $25.0 million in 
fiscal 2026 and by $52.9 million by fiscal 2030. County and Baltimore City expenditures 
increase by $97.7 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026 as a result of increasing the 
local share of annual employer pension contributions for members of TRS/TPS employed 
by local school systems and community colleges. County revenues in eight counties and 
Baltimore City decrease by $13.8 million in fiscal 2026 and by $27.7 million annually 
beginning in fiscal 2027 as a result of phasing out, over two years, the annual mandated 
appropriation for teacher retirement supplemental grants. Local expenditures increase by 
$21.2 million in fiscal 2026 and by $23.0 million in fiscal 2030 as a result of increasing 
the local cost share amount, from 50% to 90%, that Baltimore City and county governments 
are required to pay SDAT for property valuation. The fiscal 2026 effects of these provisions 
on local government finances are summarized in Appendix C (on page 243). 
 
Approximately 16 other provisions also affect local finances, half of which stem from local 
governments receiving less funding from State-funded programs. Local expenditures 
increase for partial reimbursement of State expenditures for individuals erroneously 
convicted, sentenced, and confined under State law and for the purchase of new tires 
beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the new tire fee. Prince George’s County Board of 
Education expenditures increase, likely by at least $200,000, to procure an independent 
certified public accounting firm to conduct a required audit. Montgomery County may 
request, and require MDH to delegate, authority to conduct nursing home surveys and 
complaint investigations to the county if MDH failed to comply with specified survey 
requirements in fiscal 2023 and 2024. To the extent Montgomery County is granted 
delegation authority to conduct surveys and complaint investigations, Montgomery County 
expenditures increase by an indeterminate but potentially significant amount beginning as 
early as fiscal 2026 to pay 50% of the costs for up to 60 months, as specified. 
Montgomery County estimates that additional staff will be required to conduct nursing 
home surveys and complaint investigations in the county.

HB 352/ Page 16 
However, notably, local income tax revenues increase by approximately $21.0 million or 
more beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the phase out of itemized deductions and 
enhancements to the standard deduction. Local income tax revenues may also increase 
beginning in fiscal 2026 to the extent counties alter income tax rates in a revenue-raising 
manner in response to the authorization to increase the maximum income tax rate a county 
may impose on Maryland taxable income from 3.2% to 3.3%. For tax year 2026 and 
beyond, counties that impose the current maximum county income tax rate of 3.2% on all 
Maryland taxable income have the necessary flexibility to adopt revenue-neutral, 
bracket-based income tax rates, should they opt to do so. Additionally, local governments 
may benefit from $50.0 million of ACP funds in the Maryland Energy Administration 
being used for local government renewable energy projects.

Reduce Mandate for Tree Planting on Agricultural Land 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Reduces the amount of funding that the Governor must provide for 
tree planting on agricultural land from $2.5 million to $0.5 million for fiscal 2025 through 
2031. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $2.0 million 
general fund reductions in fiscal 2025 and 2026, contingent on the enactment of legislation 
reducing the mandate.

State Effect:  General fund expenditures decrease by $2.0 million annually in fiscal 2025 
through 2031. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapter 645 of 2021 (Tree Solutions Now Act of 2021) established 
a new policy of the State to support and encourage public and private tree-planting efforts, 
with the goal of planting and helping to maintain five million sustainable native trees in 
the State by the end of calendar 2031. To help achieve this goal, Chapter 645 altered and 
directed additional resources to a number of existing programs and initiatives. For plantings 
on agricultural land, Chapter 645 specifies that a landowner who enrolls land planted with 
a forested streamside buffer receives a one-time signing bonus of up to $1,000 per acre of 
land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). In fiscal 2023, 
$2.5 million was required to be transferred from the Wastewater Account of the Bay 
Restoration Fund for tree plantings under CREP and other tree-planting programs on 
agricultural land, and for fiscal 2024 through 2031, the Governor must include an annual 
appropriation of $2.5 million in the State budget for tree plantings under CREP and other 
tree planting programs on agricultural land. 
 
Recent History:  At the close of fiscal 2024, MDA reverted $2.2 million in general funds 
from its Resource Conservation Grants program, of which the majority was likely part of 
the $2.5 million budgeted that year under Chapter 645 for tree plantings under CREP and 
other tree planting programs on agricultural land.

Alter Mandate for Consumer Protection Division 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Repeals, beginning in fiscal 2026, the requirement that the Governor 
provide at least $350,000 in general funds for specified costs and investigations of the 
Office of the Attorney General (OAG), Consumer Protection Division (CPD), and instead 
requires, beginning in fiscal 2026, the use of special funds to meet this mandate. No 
specific special fund is identified as the source for the special fund authorization going 
forward. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $350,000 
general fund reduction and a $350,000 special fund appropriation, contingent on the 
enactment of legislation modifying the mandate.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund expenditures increase by $350,000 
annually beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the requirement to meet the mandate with 
special funds. General fund expenditures for OAG decrease correspondingly. The 
Department of Legislative Services notes that, while a specific source of special funds is 
not identified, the Consumer Protection Division Recoveries Fund is expected to be used, 
based on previous actions. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  CPD assists residents by providing mediation and arbitration 
service to consumers to help resolve complaints against businesses and health insurance 
carriers, registers homebuilders and health clubs, and enforces consumer laws against 
businesses engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices. The Consumer Protection 
Division Recoveries Fund receives certain revenues from cases handled by CPD. It is 
established as part of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. The fund is used for 
operating expenses, including personnel, within CPD. Accounting for this provision, OAG 
estimates that, in fiscal 2026, the fund would have a closing fund balance of $7.2 million. 
 
Recent History:  The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024 (Chapter 717) 
repealed the general fund mandate and authorized the use of special funds for fiscal 2025 
only and, beginning in fiscal 2026, reduced the general fund mandate from $700,000 to 
$350,000.

Eliminate Mandate for Maryland Watermen’s Microloan Program 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Eliminates the requirement that the Governor provide an 
appropriation of $500,000 for the Maryland Watermen’s Microloan Program (MWLP) in 
fiscal 2026. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a 
$0.5 million general fund reduction, contingent on the enactment of legislation eliminating

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by 
$0.5 million in fiscal 2026 only. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Maryland Agricultural and Resource-Based Industry 
Development Corporation (MARBIDCO) is a quasi-public economic development 
organization chartered by the State. Chapter 384 of 2022 established MWLP in 
MARBIDCO. The purpose of MWLP is to provide loans to qualified commercial 
fishermen to continue commercial operations in the State, including for purchasing boats, 
mechanical equipment, fishing gear, fishing quota, and any other item used in commercial 
seafood harvesting. For fiscal 2024 through 2026, the Governor must include in the annual 
State budget bill an appropriation of $500,000 to MWLP; the appropriation must be 
distributed to a special fund that may only be used to make loans and pay the necessary 
costs to administer and operate the program. However, as Chapter 384 did not create a new 
special fund or specify an existing special fund, in practice, the fiscal 2024 and 2025 
appropriations of $500,000 have been part of MARBIDCO’s overall general fund 
appropriation. In fiscal 2024, MARBIDCO made nine microloans between $7,000 and 
$15,000 at an interest rate of 3.00% for $133,695 under MWLP. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 573 and 574 of 2024 altered the definitions of “beginner 
waterman” and “generational waterman” so that, under MWLP, such an individual 
(1) must be a resident of the State but (2) may hold a commercial license to catch finfish, 
crabs, clams, and oysters issued by the Potomac River Fisheries Commission instead of 
just a tidal fish license issued by the Department of Natural Resources. In addition,

Alter Mandate for School Resource Officer Grant 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Remove a requirement for an annual appropriation of $10.0 million 
to the Safe Schools Fund (SSF) but maintain the mandated purpose of the appropriation for 
the School Resource Officers (SRO) grant program. Repeal the requirement that at least 
$10.0 million from SSF be used to provide grants to local school systems and local law 
enforcement agencies under the SRO grant program and the provision that authorizes SSF 
to receive revenue from the mandate. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes a $5.0 million general fund reduction, contingent on the 
enactment of legislation reducing the mandate for the appropriation to SSF.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures to capitalize SSF 
decrease by $5.0 million in fiscal 2026, reflecting the contingent reduction in the 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly. General fund expenditures decrease 
by $10.0 million in both fiscal 2027 and 2028 as adequate balance remains in SSF to meet 
the statutory requirement for a $10.0 million annual appropriation to the SRO grant 
program. No general fund savings are realized in fiscal 2029 and future years as the 
special fund balance will be exhausted and general funds will be required to meet the 
mandated appropriation to the SRO grant program. 
 
Special fund revenues decrease by $5.0 million in fiscal 2026 and by $10.0 million in 
fiscal 2027 and 2028, consistent with the decrease in general fund appropriations to the 
fund. As general funds are instead provided directly to the local school systems for the 
SRO grants, special fund revenues and expenditures decline by $10.0 million annually 
beginning in fiscal 2029 after the fund balance is exhausted. 
 
Local Effect:  The annual mandated appropriation of $10.0 million for the SRO grant 
program, which supports local school systems and law enforcement agencies, is 
unchanged, as discussed below. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 30 of 2018, the Maryland Safe to Learn 
Act, made comprehensive changes designed to improve the safety of the State’s

public schools. SSF is administered by the School Safety Subcabinet, which must establish 
procedures for local school systems and law enforcement agencies to apply for grants from 
the fund (MCSS administers the grant program under the direction of the subcabinet). The 
purpose of the fund is to provide grants to local school systems to enhance school safety, 
and it may be used only for that purpose, as specified. 
 
Each year, the Governor must include in the annual budget bill an appropriation of 
$10.0 million to the fund for the SRO grant program, and § 7-1512 of the Education Article 
requires that at least $10.0 million from the fund be used to provide grants to local school 
systems and local law enforcement agencies. The SRO grant program provides grants to 
local school systems and law enforcement agencies to assist in providing adequate law 
enforcement coverage for public schools. This includes offsetting the cost of assigning 
SROs to public schools. Chapter 179 of 2024 further authorized the use of grant funds to 
offset the cost of assigning school security employees to public schools. Grants must be 
made to each local school system in proportion to their share of public schools in the State 
and may not supplant funding that would otherwise be appropriated to local school 
systems. Any unspent funds revert to the fund each year but cannot be reallocated. 
 
In addition to the annual $10.0 million mandated appropriation for the SRO grant program, 
SSF receives an annually mandated allocation of $600,000, which is supported by revenues 
from fines on motorists driving without proper insurance. Although SSF no longer receives 
an annual mandated appropriation under this bill, the requirement that at least $10.0 million 
from SSF be used for grants to local school systems and local law enforcement agencies is 
not affected. As SSF ended fiscal 2024 with a fund balance totaling $26.6 million, it is 
assumed that MCSS can use the existing fund balance to continue making the required 
grants from SSF for at least two additional years, so special fund expenditures are not 
affected in fiscal 2026, 2027, or 2028.

Reduce State Share of Nonpublic Placement Program Cost for Educating Children

Provision in the Bill:  Reduces the State share of the cost of educating a child with 
disabilities in a nonpublic placement program by phasing in, over two years, a change in 
the additional amount above 200% of the basic cost of education that local education 
agencies are required to provide – specifically 40% in fiscal 2026 and 50% in fiscal 2027 
and subsequent years. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
a $25.0 million general fund reduction, contingent on the enactment of legislation changing 
the mandate.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by 
$25.0 million in fiscal 2026, reflecting the amount in the budget that is contingent on the 
enactment of the provision. General fund expenditures decrease by $49.9 million in 
fiscal 2027, reflecting the full phase in; subsequent decreases in general fund expenditures 
are expected to grow annually, based on inflationary increases, and reach $52.9 million in 
fiscal 2030. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  Local expenditures vary corresponding to the State/local share ratio; annual 
inflation set by MSDE based on the CPI-U index; and enrollment of students in the 
nonpublic placement program. The change in State aid is shown in Exhibit 1. 
 
Program Description:  The State and local school systems share in the costs of nonpublic 
placements for special education children who cannot receive an appropriate education in 
a public school. For those children in nonpublic placements approved by MSDE, the 
local school system contributes an amount equal to the local share of the basic cost of 
educating a child without disabilities plus two times the total basic cost. Any costs above 
this base amount are split on a State/local basis. Beginning in fiscal 2010 this share has 
been 70% State/30% local. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 648 of 2023, the Teacher Parity Pay Act, mandates an increase 
in funding for nonpublic special education teacher salaries starting in fiscal 2025 to match 
the salaries of similarly qualified public school teachers.

The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly reduces $1.5 million from the 
Community College Promise Scholarship program in both fiscal 2025 and 2026 (although 
the action for fiscal 2025 is consistent with this provision, it is not due to the provision). 
Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 554 of 2018 created the Maryland 
Community College Promise Scholarship program to provide tuition assistance for 
students attending a community college in the State and who meet specified eligibility 
criteria, including an income limitation. The Governor must appropriate at least 
$15.0 million annually for the program. The scholarship covers costs not met by any other 
student financial aid, excluding loans, also known as a last-dollar scholarship after the 
federal Pell Grant and State financial aid awards are calculated. A minimum GPA and 
credit completion are required.  
 
Chapter 634 of 2023 made each community college in the State rather than the MHEC 
Office of Student Financial Assistance responsible for the selection and distribution of 
awards. Chapters 377 and 378 of 2025 alter the eligibility for the program to allow 
part-time associate’s degree students to receive awards for up to six years, while making 
no change to the eligibility for other associate’s degree students, and clarifying that 
students pursuing licensure, certification, or participating in a registered apprenticeship 
program are eligible to receive the award for up to three years.

Recent History:  The program was established by Chapter 59 of 2021 to provide financial 
assistance to police officers. However, Chapter 100 of 2023 expanded the program to 
include parole and probation agents and increased the amount of funding the Governor is 
required to include in the annual budget bill for the program from at least $1.5 million to 
at least $5.0 million beginning in fiscal 2024. In July 2024, the Board of Public Works 
approved cost containment actions, including reducing funding for the program from 
$5.0 million to $3.9 million for fiscal 2025.

Reduce and Alter Mandate for Maryland Police Officers and Probation Agents 
Scholarship Program 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Reduce the funding the Governor must provide to the Maryland 
Police Officers and Probation Agents Scholarship Program from at least $5.0 million 
annually to at least $500,000 in fiscal 2025 and at least $2.0 million annually thereafter. 
Repeal the requirement that the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) use 
one-half of the funding ($2.5 million) for students who intend to become police officers or 
probation agents and the other half ($2.5 million) for existing police officers or probation 
agents. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a general fund 
reduction of $3,375,000 in fiscal 2025, contingent on the enactment of legislation reducing 
the mandate.

Program Description:  The Maryland Police Officers and Probation Agents Scholarship 
provides tuition assistance to Maryland students who intend to become police officers or 
parole or probation agents in the State after their graduation and existing Maryland police 
officers and parole or probation agents who are enrolled in a degree program to further 
their career. 
 
Recent History:  The scholarship program was established by Chapter 59 of 2021 to 
provide tuition assistance to aspiring and existing police officers only. However, 
Chapter 100 of 2023 expanded eligibility to encompass aspiring and existing parole and 
probation agents, decreased the amount that the Governor is required to include in the 
annual budget bill from at least $8.5 million to at least $5.0 million beginning in 
fiscal 2024, and specified how that funding is to be distributed between students who intend 
to serve in those roles and those who are already serving in them. In July 2024, the

through 2027, $600,000 annually for the Behavioral Health Care Coordination 
Value-based Purchasing (VBP) Pilot Program (along with the specified required allocation 
of those funds), and instead authorize the Governor to include $600,000 in the annual

as cost containment actions approved by the Board of Public Works in July 2025 deleted 
the fiscal 2025 appropriation for the program. 
 
Local Effect:  None.  
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 369 of 2023 established the Behavioral 
Health Care Coordination VBP Pilot Program in MDH to implement an intensive care 
coordination model using VBP in the specialty behavioral health system. Chapter 369 
requires MDH to administer the pilot program for a three-year period and requires the 
Governor to include $600,000 in the annual budget from fiscal 2025 through 2027 to 
operate the program. 
 
Beginning in fiscal 2026, MDH must allocate a percentage of the mandated appropriation 
for the pilot program to reimbursement paid based on the achievement of specified outcome 
measures. In fiscal 2027, MDH must increase this percentage over the percentage allocated 
in fiscal 2026. 
 
In January 2025, MDH indicated that, to establish the program for fiscal 2026, the 
department planned to release a request for applications by the end of calendar 2025.

Center Fund to subsidize a portion of the costs of the center, and established a $1.0 million 
annual mandated appropriation for the fund beginning in fiscal 2024. MHCC administers 
the fund and may provide an annual grant from the fund to the designated center. Patient 
Safety Center activities include (1) developing, coordinating, and implementing patient 
safety initiatives across the State; (2) being a model for patient safety innovation and 
implementation; (3) convening health care providers, patients, and families to improve the 
quality of care, reduce preventable and avoidable harm, and provide safe and equitable 
health care for State citizens; and (4) sharing information related to best practices among 
providers and patients in the State.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Pay-as-you-go general fund expenditures decrease 
by $50.0 million in fiscal 2026 and in any year that the Governor chooses to use general 
obligation (GO) bond funds. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly 
reduced $50.0 million in general funds due to the availability of GO bond funding as a 
result of this provision. GO bond funding for the program increases correspondingly. The 
2025 Capital Improvement Program also reflects $60.0 million in GO bonds annually 
through 2030 ($50.0 million of which is for the Baltimore Vacants Reinvestment 
Initiative). The fiscal 2026 capital budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
$50.0 million for the Baltimore Vacants Reinvestment Initiative. Providing funding 
through GO bonds does not affect overall State expenditures but does reallocate funding 
from other capital projects. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 639 and 640 of 2018 established the 
Continuing the CORE Partnership Fund within DHCD. The fund is a special, nonlapsing 
fund with the stated purpose of assisting DHCD, in conjunction with the Maryland Stadium 
Authority and Baltimore City, in removing blighted property within Baltimore City. For 
fiscal 2020, the Governor was explicitly authorized to include in the annual budget bill an 
appropriation of $30.0 million to the fund. For fiscal 2021 through 2024, the Governor was 
explicitly authorized to include in the annual operating budget bill an appropriation of 
$25.0 million to the fund. Chapter 335 of 2024 extended the fund indefinitely and required 
the Governor to provide $50.0 million in the annual budget bill for the program beginning 
in fiscal 2026.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by $250,000 
in fiscal 2026. Special fund revenues and expenditures decrease correspondingly. 
Chapters 479 and 480 of 2023 require that expenditures from the fund may be made only 
in accordance with the State budget. Accordingly, even though the fund is administered by 
the Maryland Forestry Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization, this analysis assumes 
that the special funds flow through the State budget. 
 
Local Effect:  To the extent local governments would otherwise receive a grant under the 
program, local revenues and expenditures decrease in fiscal 2026. In addition, local 
governments no longer benefit from the additional training and outreach provided under 
Chapters 479 and 480. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 479 and 480 established the Maryland 
Forestry Education Fund, to be administered by the Maryland Forestry Foundation. The 
purpose of the fund is to expand and enhance (1) the Maryland Forestry Foundation’s 
capacity to provide education and resources that support forest landowners in the State; 
(2) the ability of district forestry boards and the knowledge of local governments to achieve 
environmental, economic, and social sustainability of forest health and the sustainable 
management of forest resources; and (3) the ability of businesses to test innovative best 
management practices in forestry. The Governor is required to include in the annual 
budget bill an appropriation of $250,000 to the fund in fiscal 2025 and 2026 only. 
However, as part of cost containment approved at a July 2024 meeting, the Board of Public 
Works approved a deletion of the $250,000 in fiscal 2025 funding.

by $1.0 million in fiscal 2026. Expenditures are correspondingly affected.

$2.0 million for warrants and absconding grants in fiscal 2024 through 2026 for warrant 
apprehension activities in local law enforcement agencies. GOCPP is required to 
administer the funds to local law enforcement agencies. 
 
Recent History:  Though this provision also lowers the mandated amount for fiscal 2025, 
a cost containment action approved by the Board of Public Works in July 2024 already 
reduced the funding available in fiscal 2025 from $2.0 million to $1.0 million.

State Effect:  ITIF may generally be used to pay for major information technology

reductions reflect 20% of currently planned ITIF funding levels and assume that these 
funds are not otherwise spent on MITDP. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 497 of 2024 created and defined a new 
“expedited project” category and modified how ITIF funds may be used to fund both 
MITDP and expedited projects. For a project to be eligible for funding through ITIF, it 
must (1) be estimated to cost at least $5.0 million; (2) support critical business functions 
associated with the public health, education, safety, or financial well-being of the citizens 
of Maryland; or (3) be determined to require special attention and consideration by the 
Secretary of Information Technology. An “expedited project” is a project that is not an 
MITDP but receives money from ITIF in a manner that allows for modernization projects 
to move forward in a nimble and expedited manner. 
 
Chapter 497 requires at least 20% of the funding appropriated to ITIF each year to be set 
aside for expedited projects. Any amount set aside that is not used in the fiscal year must 
remain set aside in the fund and available for future expedited projects.  
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly deleted $28.8 million of funding 
budgeted for expedited projects due to delays in setting up criteria to identify expedited 
projects.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by 
$3.5 million in fiscal 2026 through 2028 due to reducing the mandated appropriation in 
those years. Special fund revenues to the Historic Revitalization Tax Credit Reserve Fund 
decrease by a corresponding amount. To the extent that reduced funding results in fewer 
tax credits being awarded, special fund expenditures also decrease in those years. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Maryland Historic Revitalization Tax Credit 
program provides State income tax credits to cover a portion of qualifying rehabilitation 
expenses at certified historic properties. Each year, the Governor must include in the budget 
an appropriation to the Historic Revitalization Tax Credit Reserve Fund, which is used to 
determine the total amount of credits that MDP can certify and ultimately to reimburse the 
State when income tax credits are claimed. Chapters 449 and 450 of 2022 mandated 
$20.0 million annually for competitive commercial credits in fiscal 2023 through 2031 and 
established a small commercial project account with mandated funding of $2.0 million 
annually in fiscal 2024 through 2031. The small commercial project account is not affected 
by this provision, though the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly deletes 
the fiscal 2026 appropriation for the small commercial project account. Tax credits are also 
available for the rehabilitation of residential properties, but these credits can be claimed 
directly through the Comptroller and are not subject to annual appropriations.

Suspend Requirement to Appropriate Surplus to Revenue Stabilization Account in 
Fiscal 2026 Only and Eliminate Postretirement Health Benefits and Pension Sweeper 
Mandates 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Suspend, for fiscal 2026 only, the requirement that the Governor 
appropriate general fund surplus to the Revenue Stabilization Account (Rainy Day Fund). 
 
Eliminate, beginning in fiscal 2024, the requirement that the Governor include an 
appropriation to the State Retirement and Pension System (SRPS) equal to one-quarter of 
the amount by which the unappropriated general fund surplus exceeds $10.0 million in the 
second preceding fiscal year, up to a maximum of $25.0 million.  
 
Eliminate, beginning in fiscal 2024, the requirement that the Governor include an 
appropriation to the Postretirement Health Benefits (better known as OPEB) Trust Fund 
equal to one-quarter of the amount by which the unappropriated general fund surplus 
exceeds $10.0 million in the second preceding fiscal year, up to a maximum of 
$25.0 million.

State Effect:  General fund expenditures decrease by $419.5 million in fiscal 2026 only 
for the Rainy Day Fund and special fund revenues decrease by a corresponding amount. 
General fund expenditures further decrease by $50.0 million in fiscal 2026 and in any 
other year in which the Governor is no longer required to allocate funds from the 
general fund surplus to the SRPS trust fund and the OPEB trust fund. Special fund revenues 
for the trust funds decrease correspondingly. Decreases in general fund expenditures for 
fiscal 2027 and 2028 reflect the assumption in the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly that both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 will close with a general fund 
surplus in excess of $110.0 million. No general fund impact is expected in fiscal 2029 
and 2030 based on the projected general fund balance in fiscal 2027 and 2028. 
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly reflects the $419.5 million 
general fund reduction to the Rainy Day Fund, and $25.0 million general fund reduction to 
each of the OPEB and SRPS trust funds, not contingent on these provisions.

HB 352/ Page 52 
As the State does not prefund OPEB costs, there are no out-year effects resulting from the 
missed payments to the OPEB trust fund. Likewise, there are no out-year effects resulting 
from the missed payments to the SRPS trust fund since SRPS no longer assumes pension 
sweeper payments are made in their actuarial assumptions. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Rainy Day Fund was established to retain State revenues to 
meet future short-term funding needs and to reduce the need for future tax increases by 
moderating revenue growth. If there is a surplus above $10.0 million, the first 
$100.0 million of unappropriated revenues two years after the close of each fiscal year 
must be appropriated to the Rainy Day Fund (receiving 50%), SRPS (receiving 25%, up to 
a maximum of $25.0 million), and Postretirement Health Benefits Trust Fund (receiving 
25%, up to a maximum of $25.0 million). Any unappropriated revenues in excess of 
$110.0 million are required to be appropriated into the Rainy Day Fund. As noted above, 
the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly anticipates a closing 
general fund balance in excess of $110.0 million for fiscal 2026, which requires an 
appropriation in fiscal 2028 under current law. 
 
Recent History:  While the general fund surplus has exceeded the threshold requiring a 
contribution to the OPEB and SRPS trust funds each year since fiscal 2017, these payments 
have been suspended in most years since the contribution was first required by statute in 
fiscal 2017; it was not included in the fiscal 2024 or 2025 budgets as enacted (consistent 
with these provisions). 
 
The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2023 (Chapter 103) altered the required 
appropriation to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal 2024 only to reduce the appropriation from 
$1.06 billion and instead provide $500.0 million only, which was later transferred to the 
Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund. The General Assembly deleted the funds 
appropriated for the Rainy Day Fund in the fiscal 2025 budget bill. The balance in the 
Rainy Day Fund is projected to be $2.05 billion, or 8.1% of projected general fund 
revenues, by the end of fiscal 2026.

Alter Local Share of Teacher and Community College Retirement System Payments 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Reduce, by $97.7 million, beginning in fiscal 2026, the State share 
of annual employer pension contributions for members of the Teachers’ Retirement 
System/Teachers’ Pension System (TRS/TPS) employed by local school systems and 
community colleges. Increase employer contributions by counties and Baltimore City 
commensurately, in proportion to their respective shares of TRS/TPS membership. Require 
local payments to be made to the Board of Trustees of the State Retirement and Pension 
System by January 1, 2026, for fiscal 2026, and by September 1 for all future fiscal years. 
Authorize the board to allow a grace period of up to 10 calendar days for local payments 
and require the Comptroller to offset any funds due or coming due for a county that is 
delinquent in its payment. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly 
includes a $97.7 million general fund reduction, contingent on the enactment of legislation 
reducing the State’s share of these retirement costs.

because employer contributions by counties and Baltimore City increase commensurately. 
The Office of the Comptroller can implement the bill with existing resources. 
 
Local Effect:  County and Baltimore City expenditures increase by a combined 
$97.7 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026, as shown in Exhibit 1. No effect on local 
revenues. 
 
Program Description:  TRS/TPS membership includes, among others, (1) teachers and 
principals employed by local school systems; (2) specified community college faculty 
members; and (3) librarians employed by county libraries. Prior to the enactment of 
Chapter 1 of the First Special Session of 2012, the State paid 100% of the employer pension 
contribution for members of TRS/TPS, including those employed by local school systems, 
community colleges, and libraries. Chapter 1 required local school systems to pay the 
“normal cost” portion of the employer contribution (the actuarial value of pension benefits 
earned in the current year), which historically has been about 4% to5% of member payroll, 
for their members. The State has continued to pay 100% of the employer contribution on

behalf of community colleges and libraries; all State payments on behalf of  
TRS/TPS members are paid with general funds. The State shares of employer TRS/TPS 
contributions for employees of local school systems and community colleges are included 
as separate line items in the respective budgets of MSDE and MHEC.

These provisions reduce the State’s share of employer pension contributions for TRS/TPS 
members employed by local school systems and community colleges annually, beginning 
in fiscal 2026. The amount of the reduction ($97.7 million) is equal to one-half of the 
year-over-year increase in employer contributions from fiscal 2025 to 2026, as determined 
by the actuary, for members employed by local school systems and community colleges. 
The amount of the reduction, however, remains constant in the out-years. Unlike Chapter 1, 
which required local school systems to pay the normal cost share for their members, these 
provisions require counties and Baltimore City to make up the reduced State share. Of the 
total amount, $92.9 million is attributable to members employed by local school systems 
and $4.8 million is attributable to members employed by community colleges.

Repeal Pension Supplemental Contribution 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Repeals, beginning in fiscal 2026, the $50.0 million annual 
supplemental contribution to the State Retirement and Pension System (SRPS) that is 
required to be paid until the system’s funding ratio reaches 85%. The fiscal 2026 budget 
as passed by the General Assembly includes a $43,587,917 general fund reduction, 
$3,541,420 special fund reduction, and a $1,866,457 federal fund reduction, all contingent 
on the enactment of legislation eliminating the pension reinvestment funding mandate.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General/special/federal/nonbudgeted fund 
expenditures totaling $50.0 million decrease annually beginning in fiscal 2026; no effect 
on revenues. No effect on future pension liabilities because the SRPS actuary stopped 
accounting for the supplemental contribution in its calculation of assets and liabilities 
beginning with the June 30, 2024 actuarial valuation. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapter 397 of 2011 (the Budget Reconciliation and Financing 
Act of 2011) included significant reforms to the benefit structure and financing of SRPS. 
The purpose of the reforms was to enhance the affordability and sustainability of the 
retirement benefits provided to State employees and teachers. Included in the reforms was 
a requirement that the Governor include in the annual budget a supplemental contribution 
in excess of the actuarially determined contribution to accelerate the system’s return to a 
stable funding level after years of being underfunded. The amount of the supplemental 
contribution was initially $300.0 million, but it has been reduced several times. Statute 
requires that the supplemental payment be paid until the system’s ratio of actuarial assets 
to actuarial liabilities reaches 85%, which is projected to occur no sooner than fiscal 2036. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 489 of 2015 reduced the annual supplemental payment to 
$75.0 million beginning in fiscal 2016, and Chapter 717 of 2024 further reduced it to 
$50.0 million beginning in fiscal 2025.

State Effect:  Special fund revenues to the Plant Protection Fund in MDA increase 
minimally in fiscal 2025 and increase by at least $113,700 annually thereafter. This 
estimate, which is based on data provided by MDA from calendar 2023, assumes that  
(1) the number of certifications and licenses issued each year remains constant over time 
(at calendar 2023 levels) and (2) the increase in inspection fees is at least $2 per acre, 
reflecting the difference between the minimum fee, on a per acre basis, under current law 
($3 per acre) and the minimum fee, on a per acre basis, under that provision (generally, 
$5 per acre). 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Secretary of Agriculture is given various responsibilities and 
authority to control plant diseases (pests), including (1) inspecting nurseries annually for 
any nursery stock infested or infected with dangerously injurious plant pests and certifying 
that the nurseries meet MDA standards; (2) inspecting and licensing plant brokers and 
dealers; (3) the ability to establish quarantines to control, retard, or eradicate dangerously 
injurious plant pests; (4) the ability to disseminate pesticides by aircraft if necessary to 
control any plant infestation, plant infection, or animal or human disease with a known or 
suspected arthropod vector; and (5) the ability to enter any public or private property in the 
State to inspect, destroy, treat, or experiment with dangerously injurious plant pests. Fees 
are collected for the certifications and licenses – as well as for inspections – and are 
deposited in the Plant Protection Fund, which is used to partially defray the cost of 
administering the plant protection provisions. Exhibit 1 shows the fees under current law 
and the fees under the provisions.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues increase by $1.0 million 
annually beginning in fiscal 2026. This estimate (1) assumes the Secretary sets 
registration/renewal fees (and the late fee) at a level that generates enough new special fund 
revenue to sustain the Weights and Measures Program in the immediate future and (2) is 
based on the fund’s expected balance at the end of fiscal 2025 and projected revenues and 
expenditures in fiscal 2026 and future years. (The program’s allowance, under the 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly, consists of $2.4 million in 
special fund expenditures and $556,612 in general fund expenditures.) 
 
General fund revenues increase minimally beginning in fiscal 2026 due to interest earnings 
generated by the new revenue, which accrues to the general fund pursuant to  
§ 8 of Chapter 717 of 2024 and § 6-226(a)(2) of the State Finance and Procurement Article.

Authorize Responsible Person Fee for Certification of Sediment and Erosion Control

Provisions in the Bill:  Authorize the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) 
to establish by regulation a fee for processing and issuing training certifications required 
for specified personnel involved in on-site clearing and grading operations or sediment 
control associated with a construction project. Require certification fee to be set at a rate 
that produces funds approximately the same as the cost of processing and issuing the 
certification. Require fee revenues to be deposited into the Maryland Clean Water Fund. 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a special fund 
appropriation of $375,000 for the Water and Science Administration in MDE, contingent 
on the enactment of legislation to establish a Responsible Personnel Training Program fee.

State Effect:  Special fund revenues increase by $375,000 annually beginning in 
fiscal 2026. This estimate assumes that MDE establishes a $75 certification fee and issues 
5,000 certificates annually. It also assumes that the fee, which must be established by 
regulation, is not assessed until fiscal 2026, so there is no impact in fiscal 2025.  
Special fund expenditures increase correspondingly, reflecting the contingent 
appropriation in fiscal 2026 and ongoing costs thereafter. 
 
Local Effect:  Minimal. Local governments must pay the fee for affected employees; 
however, the overall effect on any one local government is anticipated to be minimal. 
 
Program Description:  Any applicant for sediment and erosion control plan approval must 
certify that any “responsible personnel” involved in the construction project will have a 
certificate of attendance at an MDE-approved training program for the control of sediment 
and erosion before beginning the project. There is no fee for the training course. Certificates 
are valid for three years and are automatically renewed unless MDE notifies the certificate 
holder that additional training is needed. The certification requirement may be waived 
under specified conditions. “Responsible personnel” means any foreman, superintendent, 
or project engineer who is in charge of on-site clearing and grading operations, or sediment 
control associated with a construction project.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues for MDE’s Wetlands and 
Waterways Program Fund increase by approximately $33,600 in fiscal 2025, and by 
approximately $524,300 in fiscal 2026, increasing to $578,900 by fiscal 2030 due to 
increases in the fees for inflation, as authorized. This estimate is based on current revenues 
generated from the fees altered by the provisions (approximately $1.5 million annually) 
and information provided by MDE regarding the additional fee revenue anticipated to be 
collected from the establishment of new additional application fees for activities proposed 
in a Tier II High Quality Watershed. 
 
Because the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes language that 
reduces MDE’s general fund appropriation by $450,000, contingent on the enactment of 
legislation to increase wetlands and waterways fees, general fund expenditures for the 
program decrease by $450,000 in fiscal 2026. Future year general fund savings assume that 
the general fund appropriation for the program would have increased by 2% annually in 
the absence of the provisions. Out-year special fund expenditures increase 
correspondingly. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Wetlands and Waterways Program within MDE administers 
a statewide program for the management, conservation, and protection of Maryland’s tidal 
wetlands and nontidal wetlands and waterways. Under current law, generally, a person

must obtain a permit or license before working in wetlands in the State. Under current law, 
application fees for wetlands and waterways authorizations range from $250 to $7,500 
(multiplied by the impact area in acres). However, there are several fee exemptions. 
Application fees are paid into the Wetlands and Waterways Program Fund. 
 
Recent History:  None.

Increase Rental Property Lead Registration and Related Fees 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Alter and increase the registration fee for each rental dwelling unit 
paid by owners of affected property under the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Subtitle 
of the Environment Article. Replace an annual fee of $30 per unit with a higher fee of 
$75 per unit to be collected by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) 
once every two years. Authorize MDE to establish a protocol to stagger the registrations of 
affected property to equally divide registrations over sequential calendar years. Increase, 
from $10 to $30, the processing fee that must be paid by an owner who submits a 
certification to MDE that the rental dwelling unit is lead free. The fiscal 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly includes a $1.5 million special fund appropriation for 
MDE, contingent on the enactment of legislation to increase the rental property lead 
registration fee.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues to the Lead Poisoning 
Prevention Fund increase by an estimated $1.2 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026 
due to the increase in the fees (approximately $749,900 annually from the increase in the 
registration fee and approximately $444,600 annually from the increase in the processing 
fee). With respect to the increase in revenues from the registration fee, MDE anticipates 
collecting approximately $3.0 million annually from the registration fee under current law, 
and by increasing the fee from $30 to $75 but changing the registration from an annual 
registration to a biennial registration, MDE’s fee revenues increase by approximately 25% 
from this source. This estimate assumes that MDE establishes a protocol to stagger the 
registrations of affected property to equally divide registrations over sequential 
calendar years, as authorized by the provision. With respect to the increase in revenues 
from the processing fee, the estimate assumes that MDE collects the fee from owners for 
20,000 rental dwelling units each year. 
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $1.5 million in 
special funds for MDE’s Land and Materials Administration, contingent on the enactment 
of legislation to increase the rental property lead registration fee; thus, special fund 
expenditures increase by $1.5 million in fiscal 2026. Accordingly, in future years, it is 

END OF PAGE 66

START OF PAGE 67
HB 352/ Page 67 
assumed that special fund expenditures also increase, but by a lesser amount, 
corresponding to the estimated increase in special fund revenues each year. 
 
The Department of Legislative Services advises that it is likely that MDE does not have 
sufficient special fund revenues or fund balance in fiscal 2026 to cover the contingent 
special fund appropriation included in the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly. Accordingly, a general fund deficiency appropriation may be needed 
in fiscal 2026; any such effect has not been accounted for in this analysis. 
 
Local Effect:  Minimal or none. 
 
Program Description:  Generally, the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing law requires 
owners of affected property (defined as residential rental property built before 1978) to 
register their properties with MDE, provide educational information to tenants, and satisfy 
specified lead risk reduction, testing, and inspection requirements, as applicable. An owner 
of affected property must pay the $30 annual registration fee, per rental dwelling unit, by 
December 31 each year. An owner who acquires affected property must register the 
affected property within 30 days after acquisition. A rental dwelling unit that has been 
certified as lead free may be exempted from annual registration fees and from further risk 
reduction requirements.

Increase Voluntary Cleanup Program Fees 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase the initial application fee that an applicant must pay to 
participate in the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) from $6,000 to $10,000. Require an 
applicant to pay for any additional costs incurred by the Maryland Department of the 
Environment (MDE) if the direct costs of review of the application and administration and 
oversight of the response action plan exceed the application fee. The fiscal 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly includes $160,000 in special funds for MDE’s Land and 
Materials Administration, contingent on the enactment of legislation to increase VCP fees.

State Effect:  Special fund revenues for MDE’s Voluntary Cleanup Fund increase 
minimally in fiscal 2025, reflecting the provision’s June 1, 2025 effective date. 
Special fund revenues increase by an estimated $400,000 in fiscal 2026, reaching an 
estimated $433,000 by fiscal 2030. This estimate includes anticipated revenues from both 
the increase in the initial application fee (an increase of $4,000 per application) and the 
authorization to recover specified costs incurred by MDE that exceed the application fee 
paid by an applicant. The estimate, which is based on the number of initial applications 
MDE has received in recent years as well as information provided by MDE regarding 
recent program deficits, assumes that (1) MDE receives 30 initial applications in 
fiscal 2026, and that the number of initial applications increases by 2% annually and 
(2) costs recovered by MDE under the provision also increase by 2% annually. 
 
Because the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $160,000 
special fund appropriation, contingent on the enactment of legislation to increase the VCP 
fees, special fund expenditures increase by $160,000 in fiscal 2026. Future year estimates 
assume that special fund expenditures increase by 2% annually. 
 
Local Effect:  Minimal or none. To the extent that a local government owns an eligible 
property and applies for funding under the program, local expenditures increase. However, 
MDE advises that it receives a relatively small number of applications from local 
governments.

Program Description:  VCP provides State oversight for the voluntary cleanup of 
properties contaminated by hazardous substances. To participate in the program, an 
applicant must submit a specified application and pay the applicable application fee. Fees 
accrue to the Voluntary Cleanup Fund. MDE may use the application fees from the fund 
for activities related to the review of proposed voluntary cleanup projects and the direct 
administrative oversight of voluntary cleanup projects, including cost recovery and 
program development. Any other money in the fund may be used for any activities related 
to VCP.

Increase and Alter Maryland Department of the Environment Tire Recycling Fee  
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to 
set the existing tire recycling fee imposed on the first sale of a new tire in the State by a 
tire dealer at $1.00 per tire, beginning January 1, 2026; the current fee is $0.80 per tire. 
Authorize MDE to adjust the fee for inflation every two fiscal years, as specified, but 
establish that the fee may not exceed $2.00 per tire. Specify that MDE, instead of the Board 
of Public Works (BPW), is responsible for establishing the fee. The fiscal 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly includes $1.2 million of special funds for MDE, 
contingent upon the enactment of legislation to increase scrap tire fees.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues for MDE’s State Used Tire 
Cleanup and Recycling Fund increase by an estimated $243,910 in fiscal 2026, by 
$975,640 in fiscal 2027 and 2028, and by approximately $1.2 million in fiscal 2029 and 
2030. This estimate, which is based on recent revenues collected from the current tire 
recycling fee, reflects the increase in the fee from $0.80 to $1.00 beginning  
January 1, 2026, and a fee adjustment for inflation in fiscal 2029, as authorized. It also 
reflects a one-quarter delay in the distribution of fee revenues from the Comptroller to 
MDE, consistent with current law. 
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $1.2 million in 
special funds for MDE, contingent upon the enactment of legislation to increase scrap tire 
fees; thus, special fund expenditures increase by $1.2 million in fiscal 2026. In future years, 
it is assumed that special fund expenditures increase correspondingly to the estimated 
increase in special fund revenues each year. 
 
The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) notes that the estimated increase in 
special fund revenues is significantly less than the contingent special fund appropriation 
included in the fiscal 2026 budget. Thus, DLS advises that it is likely that MDE does not 
have sufficient special fund revenues in fiscal 2026 to cover the contingent special fund 
appropriation included in the fiscal 2026 budget and, thus, will utilize the existing fund 
balance to cover the appropriation. The estimated fiscal 2025 closing balance is 
$2.5 million. 

END OF PAGE 70

START OF PAGE 71
HB 352/ Page 71 
Although not reflected in the table above, State expenditures (multiple fund types) also 
increase minimally for the purchase of new tires beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the 
increase in the fee. 
 
Local Effect:  Minimal increase in local expenditures for the purchase of new tires 
beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the increase in the fee. Local revenues are not affected. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  A tire recycling fee is imposed on the first sale of 
a new tire in the State by a tire dealer, including new tires sold as part of a new or used 
vehicle, trailer, farm implement, or other similar machinery. The current fee, which is set 
by BPW, is $0.80 per tire; current law specifies that the fee may not exceed $1.00 per tire. 
The Comptroller must forward all tire recycling fees to MDE’s Used Tire Cleanup and 
Recycling Fund (less the costs of administration) at the end of each quarter. If the fund 
balance and projected fee revenue for the next fiscal year exceeds $10.0 million, BPW must 
adjust the fees for the next fiscal year on a pro rata basis so that the sum of unallocated 
funds and actual fees does not exceed $10.0 million. 
 
A separate provision in the bill transfers $1.0 million from the State Used Tire Cleanup 
and Recycling Fund balance to the general fund so long as the transfer occurs by  
June 30, 2026.

Increase and Alter Fees Related to Surface Mining 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase and alter specified surface mining license and permit fees 
which accrue to the Surface Mined Land Reclamation Fund, among other changes. Increase 
the surface mining license fee from $300 to $400. Increase the per-acre fee, with respect to 
surface mining permits (including initial permits, permit renewals, and permit 
modifications), from $12 to $18.50, and increase the annual cap on total such fees from 
$1,000 to $3,000. Establish a new fee of 0.50 cent per ton of mined material sold per year 
and increase it by 0.13 cent per ton in fiscal 2028 and every two fiscal years thereafter. 
Increase the flat fee that accompanies permit modifications from $100 to $150, and 
increase the transfer of permit filing fee from $500 to $750. The fiscal 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly includes a $125,000 general fund reduction and a 
$650,000 special fund appropriation, contingent on the enactment of legislation to increase 
mineral, oil, and gas fees.

State Effect:  Special fund revenues increase by an estimated $27,000 in fiscal 2025, 
reflecting one month of revenues. Special fund revenues increase by an estimated $323,900 
in fiscal 2026, increasing to an estimated $401,500 by fiscal 2030. This estimate is based 
on information provided by MDE regarding recent revenues from the fees that are 
increased under the provisions. With respect to revenue from the new production fee, the 
estimate reflects the required increases in the per ton fee of mined material sold each year 
(in fiscal 2028 and 2030) and assumes that surface mining permittees pay the fee on an 
estimated 29.9 million tons of mined material annually. 
 
Because the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes language that 
reduces MDE’s general fund appropriation by $125,000, contingent on the enactment of 
legislation to increase the minerals, oils, and gas mining fees, general fund expenditures 
for the program decrease by $125,000 in fiscal 2026. Future year general fund savings 
assume that the general fund appropriation would have increased by 2% annually in the 
absence of the bill. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly also includes 
$650,000 in special funds for MDE, contingent on the enactment of legislation to increase 
the minerals, oils, and gas mining fees; thus, special fund expenditures increase by 

END OF PAGE 72

HB 352/ Page 73 
$650,000 in fiscal 2026. In future years, it is assumed that special fund expenditures 
increase correspondingly to the estimated increase in special fund revenues each year. 
 
The Department of Legislative Services advises that, not only do these provisions 
effectuate the contingent reduction in general funds for the program in fiscal 2026, as 
discussed above, but also, the estimated increase in special fund revenues in fiscal 2026 is 
less than the contingent special fund appropriation included in the fiscal 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly. Thus, it is likely that MDE does not have sufficient 
special fund revenues or fund balance in fiscal 2026 to cover the contingent special fund 
appropriation. Accordingly, a general fund deficiency appropriation may be needed in 
fiscal 2026; any such effect has not been accounted for in this analysis. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Under current law, a person may not engage in surface mining 
within the State without first obtaining a surface mining license. The license application 
fee is $300. Additionally, a licensee may not engage in surface mining within the State 
except on affected land that is covered by a valid surface mining permit. A permittee may 
apply at any time for modification of the permit; the permit modification fee is $100. In 
addition, a fee of $12 for each additional acre of affected land over and above the amount 
of land covered in the original permit, for each year of operation, must be charged. This 
additional fee may not exceed $1,000 per year. Generally, the fee to renew a permit is  
$12 per acre of affected land for each year of operation, not exceeding $1,000 per year. 
There is also a $500 filing fee that must be paid when the interest of a permittee in any 
uncompleted mining operation is sold, leased, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, as 
specified. 
 
The Surface Mined Land Reclamation Fund may be used by MDE to administer and 
enforce the laws governing surface mining in the State, including, under specified 
circumstances, for the reclamation of pre-law surface mines.

Establish Fee for Administration of Unemployment Insurance 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Apply, beginning January 1, 2026, an administrative fee of 0.15% 
to all taxable employers and deposit all associated revenue into the Special Administrative 
Expense Fund (SAEF) in the Maryland Department of Labor (MD Labor). Authorize the 
fee revenue to be used for specified administrative expenses of the department’s 
Division of Unemployment Insurance, including those to collect and administer the fee. 
Prohibit the fee revenue from being used for the administrative expenses of the 
department’s Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning. Reduce, beginning 
January 1, 2026, the unemployment insurance (UI) tax rate assigned to each taxable 
employer by 0.15%, subject to a minimum overall tax rate of 1.0% for new employers. 
Make related and conforming changes to SAEF and the Unemployment Insurance Trust 
Fund (UITF). Authorize the Secretary of Labor to adopt implementing regulations.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues for MD Labor (specifically, 
SAEF) increase by approximately $33.0 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026. 
Special fund expenditures for MD Labor (specifically, SAEF) increase correspondingly for 
authorized administrative purposes. MD Labor advises that it will use its authority to 
collect a full year’s administrative fees in fiscal 2026 despite the January 1 start date, and 
that initial implementation and ongoing administrative costs associated with collecting the 
fee are minimal. Nonbudgeted revenues for UITF decrease by identical amounts. 
Nonbudgeted expenditures for UITF are not affected. 
 
This estimate assumes total taxable wages of approximately $22.0 billion annually; actual 
amounts in any fiscal year depend on total taxable wages subject to the administrative fee. 
Total taxable wages vary slightly with economic conditions but generally increase slowly 
over time. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
$33.0 million in special funds for SAEF, contingent on enactment of legislation 
establishing an administrative fee for UI. The fiscal 2026 budget also includes 
125 additional permanent positions in MD Labor’s Division of Unemployment Insurance, 
which are not contingent on legislation, although MD Labor advises that the positions are 
partially funded by the administrative fee. 

END OF PAGE 74

START OF PAGE 75
HB 352/ Page 75 
Continuously reducing revenues for UITF may eventually change the rate table in effect in 
a particular year as the fund balance decreases from what it would otherwise have been to 
an amount that triggers a rate table change. However, based on the current UITF balance, 
and typical UITF balance growth even in Table A, that is not likely to occur until there is 
a period of high unemployment. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Generally, funding for state UI programs is provided by employers 
through UI taxes paid to both the federal government for administrative and other expenses 
and to the states for deposit in their UI trust funds. Using federal tax revenues, each state 
UI program is administered pursuant to state law by state employees, subject to broad 
federal guidelines. MD Labor’s Division of Unemployment Insurance administers the 
State’s UI program. 
 
Most Maryland employers pay State UI taxes, although State and local governments and 
some nonprofits elect to instead reimburse UITF for claims paid. Generally, the 
State UI tax rate is a function of an employer’s specific UI claims history and the applicable 
tax table, which is based on the State’s UITF balance. State UI taxes and reimbursements 
are typically due quarterly. As UI taxes are applied to the first $8,500 earned by each 
employee, each calendar year, the first two quarterly tax payments are typically the largest. 
 
As of April 1, 2025, the UITF balance was $1.9 billion. The State is in Table A in 2025, 
the lowest range of tax rates. Based on the current taxable wage base, Table A applies when 
the UITF balance exceeds approximately $1.06 billion; balances below that amount result 
in other tax tables (B through F) with higher rates.

State Effect:  General fund revenues increase by $205.1 million in fiscal 2026 and 
$63.8 million in fiscal 2027 due to reducing the cap to $0 in each of those years. There is 
no revenue volatility adjustment forecasted for fiscal 2028 and 2029. (The fiscal 2026 
budget as passed by the General Assembly assumes $205.1 million in revenues.) 
Special fund revenues for the Revenue Stabilization Account (Rainy Day Fund) and 
Fiscal Responsibility Fund each decrease by as much as $102.6 million in fiscal 2026 and 
$31.9 million in fiscal 2027, representing the amount that would have gone to each fund if 
the revenues exceeding the cap were realized. Special fund expenditures from the 
Fiscal Responsibility Fund decrease by the amount that would have been appropriated from 
the fund based on the amounts received in the second preceding year in fiscal 2028 and 
2029 if the revenue exceeding the cap were realized. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapters 4 and 550 of 2017 established a cap on income tax 
nonwithholding revenues. The cap applies when the share of estimated general fund 
revenues attributable to income tax nonwithholding sources exceeds the 10-year average. 
If nonwithholding revenues, as a percentage of general fund revenues, are less than the 
10-year average percentage, there is no effect. The cap requires reducing the estimate of 
nonwithholding income tax revenues so that nonwithholding income tax revenues as a 
share of general fund revenues do not exceed the 10-year average. In some years, actual 
income tax nonwithholding revenues will exceed the capped estimate. In those years, the 
Acts specify how the excess revenues are to be allocated. The excess revenues are to be 
distributed (1) to close any revenue gap for the fiscal year; (2) to the Rainy Day Fund (if 
the account is less than 6.0% of general fund revenues), the amount that is required to 

END OF PAGE 76

START OF PAGE 77
HB 352/ Page 77 
provide a balance in the account of 6.0% of general fund revenues; and (3) the remainder 
split 50.0% to the Rainy Day Fund and 50.0% to the Fiscal Responsibility Fund. 
 
The Fiscal Responsibility Fund was established to hold the amount of nonwithholding 
income tax revenues that exceed the capped estimate. The funds are to be used only to 
provide pay-as-you-go capital funds for (1) public school construction and public school 
capital improvement projects; (2) capital projects at public community colleges; and 
(3) capital projects at four-year public institutions of higher education. The funds are 
required to be appropriated in the second following fiscal year. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 4 and 550 originally set the cap on the revenue volatility 
adjustment at 2.0% of general fund revenues beginning in fiscal 2020, but legislation has 
delayed or modified the 2.0% cap. Most recently, Chapter 717 of 2024 
(Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024) altered, in fiscal 2024 and 2025, the

Increase Mobile Sports Wagering Tax Rate from 15% to 20% 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase the mobile sports wagering tax rate from 15% to 20% 
and, beginning in fiscal 2026, distribute 25% of those mobile sports wagering revenues to 
the general fund. Modify the sports wagering license renewal fee to clarify legislative 
intent of the renewal fees.

State Effect:  The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund (BMFF) special fund revenues 
increase by $2.9 million in fiscal 2025, reflecting one month of revenues due to increasing 
the mobile sports wagering tax rate. General fund revenues increase by at least 
$31.8 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026, reflecting the change in the mobile sports 
wagering revenue distribution from BMFF to the general fund, annualization, and 
anticipated growth in sports wagering revenues. (The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly assumes $31.8 million in general fund revenues and $2.5 million in 
BMFF special fund revenues.) Current projections indicate general funds will be needed to 
support Blueprint costs beginning in fiscal 2027. It is, therefore, assumed that the BMFF 
revenues of $2.9 million from fiscal 2025are expended in fiscal 2027 rather than being 
used for other BMFF costs before then. Thus, in fiscal 2027, special fund expenditures 
increase by $2.9 million, while general fund expenditures correspondingly decrease.  
 
Modifying the sports wagering license renewal fees does not materially affect BMFF 
special fund revenues as it clarifies legislative intent, though increasing the mobile sports 
wagering tax rate causes mobile sports wagering licensees to retain less revenues, thereby 
reducing sports wagering license renewal fee revenues when mobile sports wagering 
licensees renew their licenses every five years. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 492 of 2020 authorized sports and event 
wagering generally, subject to voter referendum, which was approved by Maryland voters 
in November 2020. The Act also specified that revenues from sports and event wagering 

END OF PAGE 78

HB 352/ Page 79 
must primarily be used for public education. Chapter 356 of 2021 implemented sports and 
event wagering in the State and provided for regulation of sports wagering by the 
State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission. 
 
Licensees retain 85% of sports wagering proceeds, with the remainder distributed to 
BMFF. Revenues accruing to BMFF are to be used to provide a world-class education for 
early childhood and K-12 students so that they are prepared for college and a career in the 
global economy. 
 
The license term for a sports wagering license is five years. The license renewal fee equals 
1% of the licensee’s average annual proceeds from sports wagering revenues for the 
preceding three years, less proceeds distributed to the State. From the application and 
license renewal fees collected for sports wagering, the Comptroller must pay an amount to 
SLGCA necessary to reimburse SLGCA for expenses related to the issuance and renewal 
of sports wagering licenses, 5% collected for Class A-1 and A-2 licenses to the Small, 
Minority-Owned, and Women-Owned Business Sports Wagering Assistance Fund, and the 
remainder to BMFF.

Provisions in the Bill:  Repeal the authorization for interest and investment earnings on 
the Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) to be held in the fund, remove an exemption 
on SEIF interest being directed to the general fund contained in § 8 of the Budget 
Reconciliation and Financing Act (BRFA) of 2024 (Chapter 717), and authorize the 
transfer of interest earned on SEIF in fiscal 2025 to the general fund, so long as the transfer 
occurs before June 30, 2025.

State Effect:  General fund revenues increase by $35.0 million in fiscal 2025 and by 
$30.0 million in fiscal 2026. Future years are assumed to reflect projected decreased 
interest earnings as a result of reduced SEIF fund balances and lower expected interest 
earnings. Special fund revenues for SEIF decrease correspondingly. Special fund 
expenditures for SEIF may likewise decrease beginning as early as fiscal 2026 as those 
funds are no longer available for eligible purposes; amounts in any particular year are 
unknown. 
 
This analysis does not reflect any change in SEIF fund balances stemming from  
Senate Bill 937 and House Bill 1035 of 2025; as such, the actual impact may vary. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapters 127 and 128 of 2008 created the Maryland Strategic 
Energy Investment Program and the implementing SEIF to decrease energy demand and 
increase energy supply to promote affordable, reliable, and clean energy. SEIF is primarily 
funded through the proceeds from the auction of carbon allowances under the 
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); the fund also receives revenues from 
compliance fees – often referred to as Renewable Portfolio Standard alternative compliance 
payments (ACPs) – generated under the State’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard. 
Although not required under statute, SEIF has held funds from various settlement 
agreements and orders related to Public Service Commission utility cases. 
 

END OF PAGE 80

START OF PAGE 81
HB 352/ Page 81 
RGGI proceeds must be used for the following purposes:  (1) at least 50% for energy 
assistance programs in the Department of Human Services; (2) at least 20% for energy 
efficiency and conservation (at least one-half of which must be used for  
low- and moderate-income programs); (3) at least 20% for renewable and clean energy 
programs, energy-related education and outreach, and climate change and resiliency 
programs; and (4) up to 10% but no more than $7.5 million for administrative expenses. 
Generally, ACP revenues may be used only to make loans and grants to support the creation 
of new renewable energy sources in the State that are owned by or directly benefit specified 
communities, households, or businesses. Interest earnings are deposited into the 
Administration account. 
 
Recent History:  The BRFA of 2024 redirected interest earned on a variety of 
special funds to the general fund for fiscal 2024 through 2028, with the exception of certain 
special funds and accounts which were specifically exempted. SEIF was one of the 
specifically exempted funds. 
 
The BRFA of 2024 also authorized the transfer of $90.0 million from the SEIF balance to 
the Dedicated Purpose Account in fiscal 2025 to be used to help implement the Climate 
Solutions Now Act of 2022 and Maryland’s Climate Pollution Reduction Plan and required 
at least 50% of funds transferred to support programs serving low- to moderate-income 
communities. 
 
Other provisions in the BRFA of 2025 expand the use of SEIF for the Maryland 
Department of the Environment and authorize a transfer of fund balance from the  
ACP sub-account of SEIF to the general fund. These provisions are discussed elsewhere in 
this fiscal and policy note.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by approximately 
$2.5 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026, based on previous fiscal years’ A&A tax 
revenues on electronic bingo and electronic tip jars and assuming no growth in revenues. 
(The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly assumes $2.5 million in 
revenues). Special fund revenues to MEIF decrease correspondingly. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  A State A&A tax is imposed on the net proceeds derived from any 
charge for the operation of an electronic bingo machine permitted under a commercial 
bingo license or an electronic tip jar machine authorized under Title 13 of the Criminal 
Law Article that is operated for commercial purposes. The combined State and local tax 
rate may not exceed 35%. Revenues attributable to a State A&A tax rate of 20% imposed 
on electronic bingo and electronic tip jars are distributed to MEIF. The tax is currently only 
imposed in Anne Arundel and Calvert counties. 
 
MEIF is administered by Commerce and offers a State match to private funds to support 
research endowments in scientific and technical fields at nonprofit higher education 
institutions. Under current law, the Governor must annually include, when combined with 
the amount received from the State A&A tax, at least $8.5 million for MEIF through 
fiscal 2026.

Increase Motor Vehicle Administration Cost Recovery from Miscellaneous Vehicle 
Titling, Vehicle Certificate, and Vehicle Registration Fees 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) to increase the 
level of miscellaneous fees related to vehicle titling, vehicle certificates, and vehicle 
registration fees. Alter the definition of “miscellaneous fees” to include all fees collected 
by MVA other than three-fourths (rather than one-half) of the certificate of title fee (which, 
given the doubling of that fee, maintains the same level of funding from that source). 
Further authorize MVA to increase the level of miscellaneous fees to up to 105% of its cost 
recovery needs but require the fees to be set to at least 100%, rather than 95%, of that 
amount, based on the sum of (1) the approved operating budget for MVA for the relevant 
fiscal year; (2) the average annual capital program of MVA as reported in the  
six-year Consolidated Transportation Program; and (3) MVA’s portion of the cost of the 
Maryland Department of Transportation’s (MDOT) data center operations (except for the 
cost of data center operations attributable to other administrations’ activities). Require 
revenue increases attributable to this provision to remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Agency:  MDOT (MVA) 
 
Type of Action:  Revenue action 
 
State Effect:  As shown in Exhibit 1, the current statutory requirement for MVA to set the 
levels of miscellaneous fees at 95% of specified costs is not being fully met. Exhibit 1 also 
shows projected cost recovery levels under current law from fiscal 2025 through 2030. In 
fiscal 2026, the projected level of these fees is only expected to cover about 93% of the 
applicable costs (i.e., below the 95% threshold noted above). Additionally, Exhibit 1 shows 
the amount of additional fee revenues needed to meet the 100% cost recovery requirement 
under the bill, relative to current fee revenue projections. Some portion of those fee 
revenues may be collected due to other provisions in the bill. Thus, Transportation Trust 
Fund revenues likely increase annually by an indeterminate amount beginning in 
fiscal 2026.

Accelerate Increases in Annual Vehicle Registration Fee for Certain Classes of

Provisions in the Bill:  Accelerate, from fiscal 2027 to fiscal 2026, the annual vehicle 
registration fee increases for certain classes of vehicles – specifically, make Class A 
(passenger), Class M (multipurpose), and Class E (truck) vehicles subject to the fully 
phased-in fee amounts established by the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act 
(BRFA) of 2024 (Chapter 717) beginning July 1, 2025. Require revenue increases

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) revenues from 
vehicle registration fees increase by $52.3 million in fiscal 2026 only. This estimate reflects 
the additional amount payable for registration in fiscal 2026; given the existing 
authorization for owners to opt to pay registration fees through installment plans, some 
portion of that revenue may be deferred to another year. TTF expenditures increase for 
additional credit card processing fees charged, commensurate with the increase in 
registration fee revenues paid by vehicle owners who use credit cards for their transactions. 
This estimate assumes that approximately 70% of transactions are subject to a credit card 
processing fee and the average fee paid is 3%. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of these provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Vehicle registration fees support TTF and the 
Gasoline and Motor Vehicle Revenue Account (an account within TTF that provides 
transportation aid to local governments). Registration fee revenues also support MDOT’s 
bonding capacity. Fees vary by class and, for certain classes, depend on the shipping weight 
of the vehicle. Most classes of vehicle may register for one or two years. Registration fees 
vary based on a vehicle’s characteristics (e.g., class and weight, whether the vehicle is an 
electric drive vehicle, etc.).

State Effect:  MDOT advises that Transportation Trust Fund revenues increase by 
approximately $5.0 million annually under these provisions, which accounts for higher 
registration fees for nonrental vehicles beginning July 1, 2025 (i.e., due to separate 
provisions of the bill). This estimate is based on projections from MVA for which the 
underlying assumptions were not shared. However, MVA indicated for a separate bill that 
there are more than 65,000 rental vehicles registered in the State. Therefore, under these 
provisions, the average annual registration fee increase is approximately $75.00 per rental 
vehicle. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of the provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Registration fees for rental vehicles differ from 
standard vehicle registration fees. Exhibit 1 shows the annual registration fee for various 
classes of rental vehicles. 
 
The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024 phased in increases in vehicle 
registration fees for most classes of vehicles, established a new, lower, weight division 
within certain vehicle classes and allowed for installment payments of vehicle registration, 
but it did not alter registration fees for rental vehicles. Another set of provisions in the bill 
accelerates, from fiscal 2027 to 2026, the annual vehicle registration fee increases for 
certain classes of vehicles.

Establish $5 Fee for Purchase of Each New Tire  
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require, beginning January 1, 2026, that a $5.00 fee be imposed 
on the first sale of a new tire in the State by a tire dealer, including new tires sold as part 
of a new or used vehicle, trailer, farm implement, or similar machinery. Require each tire 
dealer to (1) pay the fee; (2) complete and submit, under oath, a return; and (3) remit the 
fees to the Comptroller, as specified. Require the Comptroller to forward all new tire fees, 
less the costs of administration, to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) and that the 
revenue remain allocated within the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). 
Require the Comptroller to administer the new tire fee and authorize the Comptroller to 
adopt regulations necessary to administer, collect, and enforce the new tire fee. Conform 
tax return provisions to apply to the new fee.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues and expenditures for the 
Comptroller’s Office increase by $75,000 in fiscal 2026 only, reflecting administrative 
costs and related cost recovery. TTF revenues increase by an estimated $10.1 million in 
fiscal 2026 (which reflects net revenues after cost recovery by the Comptroller’s Office) 
and by $24.4 million annually thereafter; this estimate, which is based on recent revenues 
collected from an existing tire recycling fee imposed under the Environment Article, 
reflects the $5.00 fee beginning January 1, 2026, and a one-month delay in the distribution 
of fee revenues from the Comptroller to TTF, consistent with the provisions. 
 
Although not reflected in the table above, State expenditures (multiple fund types) also 
increase for the purchase of new tires by State agencies beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the 
new tire fee. The magnitude on any individual agency depends on the number of new tires 
purchased. 
 
Local Effect:  Local expenditures increase for the purchase of new tires beginning in 
fiscal 2026 due to the new tire fee. The magnitude on any individual local government 
depends on the number of new tires purchased. Local revenues are not affected.

Program Description:  Separate from the new tire fee established by these provisions, a 
tire recycling fee is imposed on the first sale of a new tire in the State by a tire dealer, 
including new tires sold as part of a new or used vehicle, trailer, farm implement, or other 
similar machinery. The current tire recycling fee is $0.80 per tire, and current law specifies 
that the fee may not exceed $1.00 per tire; separate provisions in this bill alter that tire 
recycling fee. The Comptroller must forward all tire recycling fees to the Maryland 
Department of the Environment’s Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund (less the costs 
of administration) at the end of each quarter. 
 
Recent History:  None. 
 
Additional Comments:  This analysis assumes that “tire dealer,” as it applies to these 
provisions, includes a person who sells new tires to a consumer of a tire on which a new 
tire fee (as opposed to a recycling fee, as specified in the provisions) has not been paid.

Increase Vehicle Emissions Inspection Fee and Index It to Inflation 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Authorize the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) to increase 
the testing fee for the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program (VEIP) to a maximum of $30 
(rather than $14) beginning July 1, 2025. Require, beginning July 1, 2026, the fee to be 
adjusted for inflation, as specified, but to remain unchanged if there is a decline (or no 
growth) in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers. Require revenue 
increases attributable to these provisions to remain allocated within the Maryland 
Department of Transportation (MDOT). Although not specifically required, MVA plans to 
make a corresponding increase in the late fee (from $15 to $30) by regulation.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) revenues increase 
by approximately $30.0 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026, assuming MVA 
increases both the VEIP testing fee as well as the late fee on July 1, 2025. Although the 
estimate assumes the fee is raised to the maximum permissible amount (i.e., from $14 to 
$30), it does not account for the impact of the required CPI adjustments, which could 
further increase TTF revenues beginning in fiscal 2027. Moreover, as MDOT advises the 
current $14 fee is sufficient to cover the VEIP contractor’s costs, the additional revenues 
received due to the fee increase are retained by TTF. Accordingly, expenditures are not 
affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of these provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description:  Generally, all model year 1977 and newer vehicles in the State 
must be inspected and tested every two years, unless specifically exempt. MVA and the 
Maryland Department of the Environment must set the VEIP fee for each vehicle to be 
inspected and tested, which may not exceed $14. The current fee is $14. A specific portion 
of the fee must be paid or retained by MVA to cover the administration and enforcement 
costs of VEIP, as provided in the contract between the contractor and the State. The VEIP 
late fee ($15) is assessed the day after the inspection due date and every four weeks 
thereafter and accrues to TTF. 
 
Recent History:  None.

Accelerate Reduction in Annual Film Production Activity Tax Credit Funding 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Reduces, from $20.0 million to $12.0 million, the aggregate amount 
of film production activity tax credit certificates that may be awarded in fiscal 2026 – thus 
accelerating by one year the phaseout of temporary enhancements to annual program 
funding.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2026 only, general fund revenues increase 
by $6.0 million, Higher Education Investment Fund and Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) 
revenues increase by $0.5 million and $1.5 million (respectively), and TTF expenditures 
for local highway user revenues increase by $0.3 million. Based on historic tax credit 
claims, this estimate assumes that credits are claimed against the corporate income tax. 
Actual revenues and expenditures may differ from this estimate based on the timing and 
volume of fiscal 2026 tax credit claims in the absence of the provision. 
 
Local Effect:  Local highway user revenues increase by $0.3 million in fiscal 2026. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  A qualified film production entity may apply for 
and claim a refundable credit against the State income tax for film production activities in 
the State in an amount equal to 28% of qualified total direct costs (30% for a television 
series) as stated on a final tax credit certificate approved by the Secretary of Commerce. 
Commerce may not approve credits totaling more than $10.0 million in aggregate for a 
single film production activity. 
 
Chapter 434 of 2023 increased the maximum amount of credits Commerce may award 
annually from $12.0 million to $15.0 million for fiscal 2024, $17.5 million for fiscal 2025, 
and $20.0 million for fiscal 2026. For fiscal 2027 and beyond, the annual limit on aggregate 
tax credit awards returns to $12.0 million. Any unused amount may be issued in a 
subsequent year. Commerce must reserve 10% of the total authorized amount each year for 
Maryland small or independent film entities.

Temporarily Reduce Cap on Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Reduce the total amount of the Student Loan Debt Relief Tax 
Credit that may be approved by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for 
tax year 2025 from $18.0 million to $9.0 million. Require MHEC, by January 1, 2026, to

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by $9.0 million in 
fiscal 2026 only, reflecting a one-time reduction in the amount of tax credits that may be 
approved by MHEC for tax year 2025. The amount authorized for tax credits returns to 
$18.0 million in tax year 2026, so there is no effect in the out-years. MHEC can complete 
the report with existing resources. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit 
provides a refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified undergraduate and graduate 
student loan debt to Maryland residents. Qualifying taxpayers must have had at least 
$20,000 in total undergraduate and/or graduate student debt and a remaining balance of at 
least $5,000 to be eligible for the credit. Chapter 738 of 2023 doubled the maximum 
amount of student debt relief tax credits that MHEC may approve from $9.0 million to 
$18.0 million in tax years 2023 and beyond and requires MHEC to annually reserve 
$9.0 million of the authorized credit for State employees. In addition, MHEC is required 
to prioritize tax credit recipients and amounts based on specified criteria, and recipients 
must use the credit within three years to pay down the student loan. 
 
Due to the reduced amount of the authorized tax credits for tax year 2025, recipients of the 
tax credit will likely be only State employees, as the requirement to reserve $9.0 million 
for State employees is unchanged by this provision.

Alter More Jobs for Marylanders Tax Credit Reserve Fund and Authorize Transfer 
to General Fund 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require, beginning in fiscal 2026, the Comptroller, upon 
notification that a final credit amount in the More Jobs for Marylanders (MJM) program 
by the Department of Commerce has been certified, to transfer an amount equal to the 
credit amount in the initial tax credit certificate, instead of the amount in the final tax credit 
certificate, from the MJM Tax Credit Reserve Fund to the general fund. Authorize the 
Governor to transfer $4.3 million from the MJM Tax Credit Reserve Fund to the 
general fund, so long as the transfer occurs by June 30, 2025.

State Effect:  General fund revenues increase by $4.3 million in fiscal 2025 due to the 
authorized transfer from the MJM Tax Credit Reserve Fund. General fund revenues also 
likely increase in future years due to funds being transferred from the MJM Tax Credit 
Reserve Fund to the general fund at the time of notification of the final credit amount 
certified. Based on historical levels, $6.0 million is transferred to the general fund in 
fiscal 2026, escalating to $16.1 million in fiscal 2030. Expenditures are not affected. The 
fiscal 2006 budget passed by the General Assembly does not assume any fiscal 2026 
revenue from the change. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The MJM Program provides State income tax credits (and, for new 
Tier I businesses certified before June 1, 2022, certain sales tax, property tax, and corporate 
filing fee benefits) to certain businesses that create and maintain a minimum number of 
qualified jobs. Commerce certifies companies that are eligible to participate in the program 
and the value of tax credits that may be claimed. The deadline for companies to enroll was 
May 31, 2024, but companies are eligible for up to 10 years of income tax credits, so 
expenditures are expected to extend into the 2030s. 
 
The MJM Tax Credit Reserve Fund is used to reimburse the general fund for income tax 
credits claimed under the program. Currently, funds are deposited into the reserve fund 
each year based on the value of initial certificates Commerce issues under the program. 
These certificates represent the maximum value of tax credits that participants may be able 

END OF PAGE 95

START OF PAGE 96
HB 352/ Page 96 
to claim under the MJM program. After participants have completed qualifying activities 
for the program, Commerce issues final certificates, showing the maximum amounts that 
participants can actually claim on their State income tax returns. 
 
The value of final certificates is frequently lower than the value of initial certificates, but 
since deposits to the reserve fund are based on initial credits, there is an excess balance in 
the reserve fund.  
 
Recent History:  Chapter 136 of 2022 extended the program for two additional years 
(allowing for the certification of projects through May 31, 2024) and modified the program 
for projects enrolled beginning June 1, 2022, to provide only an income tax credit instead 
of also including other credits and fees for new businesses, altered the eligible number of 
years of tax credits depending on the area the business is located in, altered the value of the 
tax credit, increased the minimum number of jobs required to be created, reduced the 
maximum amount of new credits authorized to be issued annually, and eliminated the 
ability to carry over unused authorizations.

Increase Vehicle Excise Tax Rate to 6.5% 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase the vehicle excise tax rate from 6.0% to 6.5% of the fair 
market value of the vehicle beginning July 1, 2025. Require revenue increases attributable 
to this higher rate to remain allocated within the Maryland Department of Transportation 
(MDOT) and not be credited to the Gasoline and Motor Vehicle Revenue Account 
(GMVRA). Accordingly, alter statutory provisions relating to the distribution of vehicle 
excise tax revenues such that no portion of revenues attributable to the additional 0.5% tax 
is distributed to GMVRA.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2026, Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) 
revenues increase by an estimated $91.5 million, and Off-Highway Recreational Vehicle 
(OHRV) Trail Fund revenues increase by an estimated $0.1 million (reflecting an existing 
provision directing 50% of the proceeds from the excise tax imposed on OHRVs to the 
OHRV Trail Fund). Future years reflect projected growth in taxable vehicle sales. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of these provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Subject to specified exemptions, the vehicle 
excise tax is imposed for each original and subsequent certificate of title issued in the State 
for a motor vehicle, a trailer, a semitrailer, a moped, a motor scooter, or an OHRV for 
which sales and use tax is not collected at the time of purchase and for specified vehicles 
in interstate operation that are registered without a certificate of title. The tax is applied to 
the fair market value of the vehicle (as defined). Chapter 6 of the 2007 special session (the 
Transportation and State Investment Act) increased the vehicle excise tax rate from  
5.0% to 6.0% and authorized a trade-in allowance against the tax equal to the full value of 
the trade-in vehicle. Subsequent legislation extended the trade-in allowance to persons 
trading in a nonleased vehicle as part of a vehicle lease agreement and persons trading in a 
leased vehicle to enter into a lease with a different leasing company or to purchase a 
vehicle. 
 
With the exception of specified revenues from the excise tax imposed on OHRVs, the 
proceeds from the vehicle excise tax are deposited in TTF, of which two-thirds is credited

to GMVRA within TTF. A portion of funds credited to GMVRA is used to provide capital 
transportation grants to local governments (local highway user revenues). TTF revenues 
from the vehicle excise tax totaled $1.05 billion in fiscal 2024 and are projected to total 
$1.08 billion in fiscal 2025.

revenues increase by an estimated $46.1 million. Future years reflect projected growth in 
newly taxable vehicle sales. Actual revenues may differ from this estimate based on 
affected businesses’ response to the tax, which cannot be reliably predicted. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of the provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description:  Subject to specified exemptions, the vehicle excise tax is imposed 
for each original and subsequent certificate of title issued in the State for a motor vehicle, 
a trailer, a semitrailer, a moped, a motor scooter, or an off-highway recreational vehicle 
(OHRV) for which sales and use tax is not collected at the time of purchase and for

the vehicle excise tax are deposited in TTF, of which two-thirds are credited to GMVRA 
within TTF. A portion of funds credited to GMVRA are used to provide capital

Rental vehicles (as defined under § 11-148.1 of the Transportation Article) are specifically 
exempt from the vehicle excise tax. For purposes of the vehicle law, “rental vehicle” means 
a passenger car or other specified vehicle that is acquired solely for rental purposes but will 
not be rented to the same person for a period of more than 180 consecutive days, subject 
to certain other criteria and exemptions. The State imposes an 11.5% sales and use tax on 
short-term passenger car, multipurpose passenger vehicle, and motorcycle rentals and an 
8.0% sales and use tax on certain short-term truck, tractor, and trailer rentals. TTF receives 
45.0% of the proceeds from the sales and use tax on short-term vehicle rentals, and the 
Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund receives the remaining 55.0%.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Transportation Trust Fund revenues increase by 
an estimated $103.5 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026. This estimate is based on 
fiscal 2024 titling fee transactions and assumes that fees for duplicate and corrected 
certificates of title, which are set in regulation, also increase proportionately (accounting 
for $6.2 million of the increase). 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  In general, the fee for each certificate of title is $100. Reduced 
fees apply for certificates of title issued for rental vehicles ($50); off-highway recreational 
vehicles ($35); mopeds and motor scooters ($20); and trailers with a gross vehicle weight 
of 3,000 pounds or less that are transferred to a specified family member, if no money or 
other valuable consideration is involved in the transfer ($50). Fees for duplicate certificates 
of title to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged certificate of title are established by the Motor 
Vehicle Administration (MVA). 
 
On the death of a sole or joint owner of a vehicle, MVA may not charge a fee for a new 
certificate of title issued for the vehicle to a surviving spouse, as specified. Similarly, MVA 
may not charge a fee for a certificate of title issued for a vehicle that is transferred to a trust 
or from a trust to one or more beneficiaries in accordance with certain provisions of the 
Estates and Trusts Article.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. The provisions affect multiple special fund 
revenues; total special fund revenues increase by at least $6.2 million annually beginning 
in fiscal 2026. Exhibit 1 shows the estimated impact on the Transportation Trust Fund and 
other special fund revenues under the provisions. Approximately 62,800 vehicles must 
obtain standard registration plates (and pay the applicable fees corresponding to the vehicle 
class). This change also subjects the owners to paying annual surcharges related to 
emergency medical services. Further, any such affected vehicles may become subject to 
Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program (VEIP) testing, assuming the owners are not 
otherwise exempt under other provisions of State law. The estimates shown in Exhibit 1 
account for higher registration fees and VEIP fees established under separate provisions of 
the bill beginning July 1, 2025. Revenues may increase further each year as additional 
motor vehicles become 20 years old, although it is unknown to the extent that these cars 
would have registered as historic vehicles. 
 
Local Effect:  None, as transportation revenues raised as a result of the provisions must 
remain allocated within MDOT. 
 
Program Description:  A historic motor vehicle is currently defined as a motor vehicle, 
including a passenger vehicle, motorcycle, or truck, that is at least 20 years old; has not 
been substantially altered from the manufacturer’s original design; and meets criteria 
contained in MVA regulations. 
 
Recent History:  The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024 (Chapter 717)

Alter Personal Income Tax Rates, Deductions, and State Child Tax Credit 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Alter the State’s individual income tax rates and brackets; increase 
the value of the Maryland standard deduction and eliminate the phase-in of the standard 
deduction; phase out itemized deductions for certain taxpayers; and modify the State child 
tax credit to phase out the benefit gradually for taxpayers with federal adjusted gross 
income (AGI) in excess of $15,000. Apply changes, as detailed further below, to 
tax year 2025 and beyond. Require the Comptroller to waive any interest or penalty 
imposed on an individual relating to payment of estimated income tax for calendar 2025 to 
the extent the Comptroller determines that the interest or penalty would not have been 
incurred but for an increase in the income tax rates for calendar 2025 under this bill. 
 
 
Individual Income Tax Brackets and Rates:  As shown later in Exhibit 3,  
two new income tax brackets are established at the top of the income tax rate 
schedule, and the top marginal income tax rate is increased from 5.75% to 6.50%. 
 
Standard Deduction:  For tax year 2025, the maximum value of the Maryland 
standard deduction increases from $2,800 to $3,350 ($5,600 to $6,700 for 
joint filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving spouses). Consistent with 
existing law, these amounts are subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments for 
tax years after 2025. A taxpayer may claim the full value of the standard deduction 
regardless of income. 
 
Itemized Deductions:  Taxpayers with federal AGI in excess of $200,000 ($100,000 
if married filing separately) must reduce the amount of their otherwise allowable 
itemized deductions by an amount equal to 7.5% of federal AGI in excess of 
$200,000 ($100,000 if married filing separately). 
 
State Child Tax Credit:  Taxpayers with federal AGI in excess of $15,000 (the 
existing income eligibility threshold) may claim the credit for each qualified child 
at a reduced amount ($500 reduced by $50 for each $1,000 or fraction thereof by 
which federal AGI exceeds $15,000). The credit fully phases out for taxpayers with 
federal AGI in excess of $24,000. The credit is decoupled from any changes to the 
definition of a qualified dependent under § 152 of the Internal Revenue Code after 
December 31, 2024.

estimated $250,000 in fiscal 2026 only for one-time programming changes. General fund 
revenues increase by an estimated $344.4 million in fiscal 2026, reflecting the effect of 
tax year 2025 and a portion of tax year 2026. Future years reflect annualization and 
projected income growth. 
 
Exhibit 1 details the estimated State revenue effects by provision. The Department of 
Legislative Services (DLS) estimates that, were the deduction and rate provisions in effect 
for tax year 2023, taxpayers who otherwise claimed the Maryland standard deduction 
would have realized an aggregate net reduction in State income tax liability of 
$72.2 million, and taxpayers who itemized Maryland deductions would have realized an 
aggregate net increase in State income tax liability of $311.0 million.

The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made various changes to the 
federal individual income tax, most of which are scheduled to expire after tax year 2025. 
These changes include the elimination of federal personal exemptions for taxpayers and 
dependents, increases in the federal standard deduction, and the limitation and suspension

HB 352/ Page 106 
of various itemized deductions. The enhancements to the federal standard deduction and 
alterations to federal itemized deductions have increased utilization of the federal and 
State standard deductions – which, because the value of the Maryland standard deduction 
is not tied to the value of the federal standard deduction, has generated increased personal 
income tax revenues for Maryland. The December 2024 general fund revenue forecast 
assumes a reduction in State personal income tax revenues beginning in fiscal 2026 due to 
the scheduled expiration of the aforementioned TCJA changes. 
 
The estimate shown in this fiscal and policy note is based on an analysis of tax year 2023 
income tax data – a year for which the TCJA provisions were in effect – and, thus, reflects 
a scenario in which the TCJA provisions continue beyond tax year 2025. However, should 
the TCJA provisions sunset as scheduled after tax year 2025, the general fund revenue 
effects of the personal income tax provisions of this bill are greater, as some taxpayers who 
return to the itemized deduction method or claim increased or additional itemized 
deductions must reduce the amount of their otherwise-allowed itemized deductions on the 
Maryland return in accordance with this bill. The precise effect of this scenario is not 
available at this time. DLS further notes that actual revenues under these provisions may 
differ from the information presented in this analysis depending on the enactment of any 
federal income tax changes. 
 
Local Effect:  Local income tax revenues are affected beginning in fiscal 2026 due to the 
phase out of itemized deductions and enhancements to the standard deduction. As shown 
in Exhibit 2, in fiscal 2026, local income tax revenues increase by an estimated 
$28.2 million, reflecting tax year 2025 and a portion of tax year 2026. Future years reflect 
annualization and projected income growth. To the extent the individual income tax 
provisions of TCJA sunset after tax year 2025 as scheduled, local income tax revenues 
generated by the provisions of this bill are greater; however, the precise effect is not 
available at this time. Local income tax revenues generated under the provisions of this bill 
may otherwise differ from the amounts shown below, depending on the timing of local 
income tax distributions.

DLS does not have sufficient income tax data to analyze the State or local revenue effects 
of these provisions by county. However, a separate analysis prepared by the 
Comptroller’s Office estimates the State and local revenue effects of the provisions by 
county. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The individual income tax is Maryland’s largest 
source of general fund revenue. Individual income tax revenues totaled $13.6 billion for 
fiscal 2024, or 55% of total fiscal 2024 general fund revenue. 
 
State Individual Income Tax Rates:  As shown in Exhibit 3, Maryland imposes a top 
marginal State individual income tax rate of 5.75% on Maryland taxable income in excess 
of $250,000 ($300,000 for joint filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving 
spouses). Maryland taxable income is equal to federal AGI as adjusted for Maryland 
addition and subtraction modifications (Maryland AGI) minus Maryland deductions and 
exemptions. 
 
Additionally, each county and Baltimore City imposes a local income tax on the Maryland 
taxable income of its residents at a rate of at least 2.25% and up to 3.2% and may impose 
the county income tax on a bracket basis. (A separate provision of this bill authorizes 
counties to impose an income tax rate of up to 3.3%.) Nonresidents who are subject to the 
State income tax but are not subject to the county income tax are subject to the 
special nonresident tax at a rate equal to the lowest county income tax rate in Maryland 
(currently 2.25%). 
 
Maryland Deductions:  Maryland’s standard deduction is equal to 15% of Maryland AGI, 
subject to certain inflation-adjusted minimum and maximum amounts. For tax year 2025, 
the minimum and maximum standard deduction amounts are $1,850 and $2,800, 
respectively ($3,700 and $5,600, respectively, for joint filers, heads of household, and 
qualified surviving spouses). An individual who itemizes federal deductions may elect to 
itemize Maryland deductions, as specified. Maryland generally conforms to 
federal itemized deductions but disallows deductions for (1) state and local income taxes 
paid and (2) contributions of a preservation or conservation easement for which a Maryland 
income tax credit for preservation and conservation easements is claimed. 
 
State Child Tax Credit:  The State’s child tax credit was originally enacted under 
Chapter 40 of 2021 and was extended and modified by Chapters 3 and 4 of 2023. For 
tax years 2023 and beyond, resident taxpayers who have one or more qualified children 
and federal AGI of up to $15,000 may claim a refundable income tax credit equal to 
$500 per qualified child. A qualified child is a dependent of the taxpayer who is (1) younger 
than age 6 or (2) younger than age 17 and is a child with a disability (as defined).

Impose Net Capital Gain Surtax 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Impose a 2% surtax for individuals with federal adjusted gross 
income in excess of $350,000 on certain net capital gain included in Maryland adjusted 
gross income for tax year 2025 and beyond. Specify that the surtax does not apply to any 
amount of capital gain from the sale or exchange of (1) a residential dwelling sold for less 
than $1.5 million that is the individual’s primary residence; (2) assets held in specified 
retirement savings plans; (3) cattle, horses, or breeding livestock held for more than 
12 months, as specified; (4) land that is subject to or will be subject to a conservation, 
agricultural, or forest preservation easement; (5) property used in a trade or business, the 
cost of which is eligible for expensing under § 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC); or 
(6) affordable housing owned by a nonprofit organization. Distribute 37.5% of the proceeds 
from the surtax to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). Require the Comptroller to waive 
any interest or penalty imposed on an individual relating to payment of estimated income 
tax for calendar 2025 to the extent the Comptroller determines that the interest or penalty 
would not have been incurred but for an increase in the income tax rates for calendar 2025 
under this provision or other provisions.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2026, general fund and TTF revenues 
increase by an estimated $229.3 million and $137.6 million (respectively), reflecting the 
effect of tax year 2025 and a portion of tax year 2026. Future years reflect annualization 
and projected capital gains income. General fund expenditures for the Comptroller’s Office 
increase by up to $75,000 in fiscal 2026 only for one-time programming changes. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Under federal and Maryland income tax, gain or loss from the 
disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year is treated as long-term capital gain 
or loss, and gain or loss from the disposition of a capital asset that is held for one year or 
less is treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Net capital gain (net long-term capital gain 
minus net short-term capital loss) is generally taxed at preferential federal income tax rates 
(0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the taxpayer’s filing status and taxable income).

Maryland conforms to the federal income tax treatment of capital gains but taxes net capital 
gain at ordinary State income tax rates. 
 
Per § 121 of the IRC, a taxpayer may exclude from gross income up to $250,000 ($500,000 
for certain joint returns) of gain from the sale or exchange of the taxpayer’s principal 
residence. To qualify for the exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned and used the 
property as the taxpayer’s principal residence for at least two years out of the five years 
preceding the date of the sale or exchange. A taxpayer may apply the exclusion to only 
one sale or exchange within a two-year period.

Increase Maximum Allowable Local Income Tax Rate  
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase the maximum income tax rate a county may impose on 
Maryland taxable income from 3.2% to 3.3%. Authorize a county to set an income tax rate 
of 3.3% for tax year 2025 if the county notifies the Comptroller of the rate change by 
May 15, 2025, and is not requesting any other rate or bracket change for tax year 2025. 
Require the Comptroller to waive any interest or penalty imposed on an individual relating 
to payment of estimated income tax for calendar 2025 to the extent the Comptroller 
determines that the interest or penalty would not have been incurred but for an increase in 
the income tax rates for calendar 2025 under this provision or other provisions. 
 
Agency:  Comptroller 
 
Type of Action:  Revenue action 
 
State Effect:  None. 
 
Local Effect:  Local income tax revenues may increase beginning in fiscal 2026 to the 
extent counties alter income tax rates in a revenue-raising manner in response to the 
authorization. For tax year 2026 and beyond, counties that impose the current maximum 
county income tax rate of 3.2% on all Maryland taxable income have the necessary 
flexibility to adopt revenue-neutral, bracket-based income tax rates, should they opt to do 
so. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Each county and Baltimore City must impose a 
local income tax on the Maryland taxable income of its residents at a rate of at least 2.25% 
and up to 3.2%. Chapter 23 of 2021 authorized counties to impose the county income tax 
on a bracket basis; to date, Anne Arundel County has adopted bracket-based marginal 
income tax rates, and Frederick County has adopted a flat income tax rate schedule with 
rates that vary based on income level. 
 
Exhibit 1 shows the current county income tax rates for tax year 2025. As shown in the 
exhibit, 14 counties and Baltimore City impose the maximum county income tax rate of 
3.2% for tax year 2025 – including Anne Arundel and Frederick counties, which impose a 
top income tax rate of 3.2%. 
 
Nonresidents who are subject to the State income tax but are not subject to the county 
income tax are subject to the special nonresident tax at a rate equal to the lowest county 
income tax rate in Maryland (currently 2.25%).

to the amount of Maryland taxable income in excess of $400,000 ($480,000 for joint filers, heads of 
household, and qualified surviving spouses). For single filers, married individuals filing separately, and 
dependent filers, the tax year 2025 county income tax rates are 2.70% of Maryland taxable income of 
$1 through $50,000; 2.94% of Maryland taxable income of $50,001 through $400,000; and 3.20% of 
Maryland taxable income over $400,000. For joint filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving 
spouses, the tax year 2025 county income tax rates are 2.70% of Maryland taxable income of $1 through 
$75,000; 2.94% of Maryland taxable income of $75,001 through $480,000; and 3.20% of Maryland taxable 
income over $480,000.

with Maryland taxable income of more than $150,000 ($250,000 for joint filers, heads of household, and 
qualified surviving spouses). For single filers, married individuals filing separately, and dependent filers, 
the tax year 2025 county income tax rates are 2.25% for taxpayers with Maryland taxable income between 
$1 and $25,000 (inclusive); 2.75% for taxpayers with Maryland taxable income between $25,001 and 
$50,000 (inclusive); 2.96% for taxpayers with Maryland taxable income between $50,001 and 
$150,000 (inclusive); and 3.20% for taxpayers with Maryland taxable income of $150,001 or more. For 
joint filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving spouses, the tax year 2025 county income tax rates 
are 2.25% for taxpayers with Maryland taxable income between $1 and $25,000 (inclusive); 2.75% for 
taxpayers with Maryland taxable income between $25,001 and $100,000 (inclusive); 2.96% for taxpayers 
with Maryland taxable income between $100,001 and $250,000 (inclusive); and 3.20% for taxpayers with 
Maryland taxable income of $250,001 or more.

Alter Trigger for Reduced Senior Tax Credit  
 
Provision in the Bill:  Reduces, from 7.5% to 3.75%, the general fund estimate reduction 
threshold at which the value of the senior tax credit is reduced for certain taxpayers, 
applicable to tax year 2025 and beyond. 
 
Agency:  Comptroller 
 
Type of Action:  Revenue action 
 
State Effect:  No quantifiable effect on general fund revenues at this time. To the extent 
the altered threshold for the reduced senior tax credit is met, general fund revenues increase 
significantly. Expenditures are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None.  
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 3 and 4 of 2022 established a 
nonrefundable State income tax credit for resident taxpayers who are at least age 65 and 
whose federal adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $100,000 ($150,000 for joint 
filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving spouses). The amount of the tax credit 
is equal to $1,000 ($1,750 for heads of household, qualified surviving spouses, and joint 
filers if both spouses are at least age 65). For a tax year in which the September 
general fund estimate issued by the Board of Revenue Estimates for the current fiscal year 
is more than 7.5% below the March general fund estimate issued in the same year, the value 
of the tax credit is reduced by 50% for taxpayers whose federal AGI is at least $50,000 
($100,000 for joint filers, heads of household, and qualified surviving spouses).

Increase Cannabis Sales and Use Tax Rate and Alter Tax Distribution 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Increase the sales and use tax rate imposed on the retail sale of  
adult-use cannabis from 9% to 12% beginning in fiscal 2026 and alter the distribution of 
sales and use tax collections from the sale of cannabis so that the entire portion of revenue 
attributable to the higher rate is distributed to the general fund. Distribute directly to the 
general fund, for fiscal 2026 and beyond, the first 25% of cannabis sales and use tax 
collections; maintain the distribution of the remaining 75% as under current law for no net 
effect on distribution of existing revenues.

Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 254 and 255 of 2023 imposed a 9% sales 
and use tax on the retail sale of adult-use cannabis. After distributions to the Cannabis 
Regulation and Enforcement Fund to defray Maryland Cannabis Administration operating 
and administrative expenses, the Comptroller must distribute cannabis sales and use tax 
collections to the State’s general fund (50% through fiscal 2028, after which the 
general fund distribution increases to 55%); the Cannabis Reinvestment and Repair Fund 
(35% through fiscal 2033 only); counties (5% direct allocation); the Cannabis Public 
Health Fund (5%); and the Cannabis Business Assistance Fund (5% through fiscal 2028 
only). Cannabis sales and use tax revenues totaled $63.8 million in fiscal 2024, of which 
$30.5 million was distributed to the general fund. In fiscal 2025 and 2026, cannabis sales 
and use tax revenues are projected to total $86.9 million and $117.4 million, respectively, 
including $30.4 million and $45.9 million in general fund revenues.

Impose Sales and Use Tax on Data and Information Technology Services 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Expand the definition of taxable services under the State sales and 
use tax, beginning in fiscal 2026, to include data and information technology (IT) services 
described under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) sectors 5132, 
518, 519, and 5415. (NAICS sector 5132 includes software publishing services and NAICS

data processing, web hosting, and related services; (2) web search portals, libraries, 
archives, and other information services; and (3) computer systems design and related 
services.)  
 
Impose a 3.0% sales and use tax on these services and distribute the revenue to the 
general fund, among other changes. 
 
Establish that the sales and use tax on data and IT services does not apply to (1) sales of 
cloud computing services to a qualified cybersecurity business or (2) sales to or by a 
qualified company in an emerging technology development area, which encompasses 
quantum computing research and development at the University of Maryland, College Park 
Campus.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by approximately 
$482.8 million in fiscal 2026 and by $747.4 million in fiscal 2030. The fiscal 2026 estimate 
discounts expected revenues by 25% to account for start-up and initial compliance issues. 
Future years reflect annualization and inflation. 
 
The estimate is based on product line and NAICS code data from the Economic Census 
survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012 and adjusted to fiscal 2026 gross 
domestic product for Maryland. The Economic Census data reflects sales by private sector 
businesses in Maryland with at least one paid employee. It does not include any sales by 
sole proprietors or sales of services that may be purchased by Maryland residents from 
providers outside of the State that would be subject to the sales tax. Future year revenues 
are assumed to increase by approximately 3% annually. To the extent that there have been 

END OF PAGE 115

START OF PAGE 116
HB 352/ Page 116 
changes in the overall consumption of various services over the past several years, total 
sales and use tax revenues are affected accordingly. 
 
The estimate assumes a decline in taxable sales to reflect sales that would not be subject to 
Maryland sales tax for three reasons:  (1) the sale does not occur because the additional 
cost dissuades the purchaser; (2) the sale is diverted to a neighboring state where the service 
is not subject to a sales tax, or the sales tax rate is lower; or (3) the sale is made to a 
government or nonprofit entity. To the extent that the impact on sales volume varies from 
what is projected, sales tax revenues increase or decrease correspondingly. To the extent 
that businesses decrease their purchases of these services, by performing the services  
in-house, for example, revenues are lower. 
 
General fund expenditures for the Comptroller’s Office increase by $643,600 in fiscal 2026 
and by $328,300 in fiscal 2030. This estimate reflects certain one-time costs in fiscal 2026 
and a 90-day start-up delay after the provision’s July 1, 2025 effective date. 
 
The Comptroller’s Office needs to hire three financial compliance auditors to administer 
the new sales and use tax on data and IT services. Their duties include identifying and 
licensing new sales and use tax account holders, tax compliance, auditing new sales and 
use tax returns, and handling potential litigation. The estimate reflects a  
one-time expenditure increase of $400,000 in fiscal 2026 for computer programming 
modifications to the tax reporting and collection system. It includes salaries, fringe 
benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses.

Alter Annual Interest Rate Paid for Certain Sales and Use Tax Refunds 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Requires the Comptroller to set the annual interest rate paid for 
sales and use tax refunds resulting from a final decision under Potomac Edison v. 
Comptroller of the Treasury to equal the average prime rate of interest during the 
12 months immediately preceding the month in which the final decision is rendered, based 
on a determination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
Agency:  Comptroller 
 
Type of Action:  Revenue action 
 
State Effect:  General fund revenues may increase by an indeterminate amount due to a 
lower interest rate being applied to sales and use tax refunds resulting from the final 
decision in Potomac Edison v. Comptroller of the Treasury. The amount of any interest on 
refunds that may be owed cannot be reliably estimated at this time. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  By October 1 of each year, the Comptroller’s Office must set the 
annual interest rate for tax refunds and monies owed to the State for the next calendar year 
at a rate that equals the greater of (1) 12% for calendar 2017, 11.5% for calendar 2018, 
11% for calendar 2019, 10.5% for calendar 2020, 10% for calendar 2021, 9.5% for 
calendar 2022, and 9% for calendar 2023 and each year thereafter or (2) three percentage 
points above the average prime rate of interest in the previous fiscal year, based on 
information from the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
Recent History:  In the case of Potomac Edison v. Comptroller of the Treasury, the 
Comptroller’s Office has argued that certain equipment used by Potomac Edison for the 
transmission of electricity does not qualify for a sales and use tax exemption under current 
State law. However, the Maryland Tax Court has ruled that at least some of the equipment 
used by Potomac Edison in the transmission of electricity is considered to be used as part 
of a production activity and, therefore, entitled to the sales and use tax exemption. 
 
Chapter 464 of 2014 (Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2014) altered the annual 
interest rate paid for income tax refunds resulting from the final decision under Maryland 
State Comptroller of the Treasury v. Brian Wynne, et ux., 431 Md. 147 (2013).  
The Comptroller’s Office was required to use an annual interest rate equal to the average 
prime rate of interest during fiscal 2015, based on a determination by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank. The provision applied to applicable tax refunds 
for tax years 2006 through 2014.

Program and specify that the fund must be used to meet the mandated appropriation of

State Effect:  General fund expenditures for MCA decrease by $5.0 million annually 
beginning in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues and expenditures for CREF increase 
correspondingly. CREF expenditures (which this analysis assumes includes the 
$5.0 million mandated funding to support the Social Equity Partnership Grant Program) 
are deducted before cannabis sales tax revenues are distributed. Thus, $5.0 million less in 
cannabis sales tax revenues is distributed to the general fund, various special funds, and 
directly to counties. Accordingly, general fund revenues decrease by $2.5 million annually 
in fiscal 2025 through 2028, after which general fund revenues decrease by $2.75 million 
annually, reflecting a change in cannabis sales tax distribution under current law. (The 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly assumes a $2.5 million general fund 
revenue reduction in fiscal 2025 and 2026.) Special fund revenues for the Community 
Reinvestment and Repair Fund (CRRF), Cannabis Public Health Fund (CPHF), and 
Cannabis Business Assistance Fund (CBAF) decrease by a total of $2.25 million annually 
in fiscal 2025 through 2028 and by a total of $2.0 million annually thereafter. (Special fund 
revenues shown above reflect the net of CREF, CRRF, CPHF, and CBAF revenue effects.) 
Special fund expenditures for CRRF decrease by $1.75 million annually beginning in 
fiscal 2025, reflecting the decrease in CRRF revenues to counties. The net effect of 
increased CREF expenditures and decreased CRRF expenditures is special fund 
expenditures increase by $3.25 million annually.

Local Effect:  Counties receive a direct allocation of 5% of adult-use cannabis sales tax 
revenues, thus county revenues decrease by $250,000 annually beginning in fiscal 2025. 
Municipal revenues are also affected, as each county must distribute to a municipality 
located in the county 50% of the county’s allocation that is attributable to the cannabis 
sales and use tax revenue generated by a dispensary located in that municipality. Counties 
also receive funds from CRRF to provide funds to community-based organizations that 
serve communities determined to have been the most impacted by disproportionate 
enforcement of the cannabis prohibition before July 1, 2022. Thus, county revenues and 
expenditures decrease by $1.75 million annually from less available CRRF funding 
beginning in fiscal 2025. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 254 and 255 of 2023 (Cannabis Reform) 
established MCA, CREF, and the Social Equity Partnership Grant Program and required, 
beginning in fiscal 2025, the Governor to include in the annual budget bill an appropriation 
of $5.0 million for the grant program. The Social Equity Partnership Grant program 
promotes qualifying partnerships between operational cannabis licensees and social equity 
licensees. 
 
CREF is a special fund that is primarily funded through cannabis tax sales, but also includes 
revenue from licensing and fees, and the purpose of the fund is for covering the operating 
costs of MCA and for administering and enforcing the cannabis program. 
 
The sales and use tax revenues from adult-use cannabis sales are required to be distributed 
first to CREF for amounts necessary to defray MCA’s operating and administrative costs. 
Remaining tax revenues are then distributed as follows:  50% to the State’s general fund 
(through fiscal 2028, after which the general fund distribution increases to 55%);  
35% to CRRF; 5% to CPHF; 5% to CBAF (through fiscal 2028, after which this

A separate provision in the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act increases the sales 
and use tax on adult-use cannabis beginning in fiscal 2026 from 9% to 12% and alters the 
distribution of revenue raised through the sales and use tax, though that provision does not 
directly affect this provision.

Authorize Use of Expedited Service Fund for State Department of Assessments and 
Taxation Operating Costs in Fiscal 2026 and 2027 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands, in fiscal 2026 and 2027 only, the allowable uses of the 
Expedited Service Fund to authorize up to $11,000,000 in each year to be used for 
general operating expenses in the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT). 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $10,000,000 
general fund reduction and $10,000,000 special fund addition for SDAT, both contingent 
on the enactment of legislation expanding the allowable use of expedited service fees; 
SDAT is authorized to allocate the reduction and addition among programs in the 
department.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by 
$10.0 million annually in fiscal 2026 and 2027, reflecting the contingent reduction in 
fiscal 2026 and assuming a similar level of funding in fiscal 2027. Special fund 
expenditures increase correspondingly. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Revenue generated by SDAT from expedited 
services of business filing documents is deposited into the Expedited Service Fund. The 
Expedited Service Fund must be used by the department (1) for the costs of reviewing, 
processing, and auditing specified documents that are filed or requested; (2) to pay 
redemption or extinguishment amounts to former owners of ground rents redeemed or 
extinguished; and (3) for other costs incurred by the department to administer the 
provisions of the Tax – Property Article. Chapter 385 of 2024 increased, from 5% to 15%, 
the percentage of the Expedited Service Fund that may be used for administrative expenses 
under the SDAT Office of the Director.

Expand Allowable Uses of Securities Act Registration Fund 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands the allowable uses of funds in the Securities Act 
Registration Fund to include supporting the general operations of the Office of the Attorney 
General (OAG). The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
$1,690,000 in general fund reductions (within the Legal Counsel and Advice Division and 
the Civil Litigation Division of OAG) in each of fiscal 2025 and 2026 and $1,690,000 in 
special fund appropriations in each of fiscal 2025 and 2026, contingent on the enactment 
of legislation expanding the allowable uses of the Securities Registration Fund.

State Effect:  Although the provision does not set a specific dollar amount associated with 
the ability to use the Securities Registration Fund for general operating expenses in OAG, 
general fund expenditures for OAG are assumed to decrease by $1.7 million annually 
beginning in fiscal 2025, reflecting the contingent reductions in fiscal 2025 and 2026 and 
assuming a similar level of out-year funding. Special fund expenditures increase 
correspondingly. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Legal Counsel and Advice Division in OAG includes the 
Attorney General and their staff. The division is responsible for the management and 
administration of OAG. The Civil Litigation Division handles major civil litigation in 
which the State, its agencies, or officers is a party. The division defends the State and 
State employees in State and federal trials and appellate courts, as well as files suits on 
behalf of the State. The Securities Act Registration Fund receives revenues from fees paid 
for securities registrations. 
 
Recent History:  A separate provision increases the fee for an initial and renewal 
registration and transfer of registration as an agent for securities registration by $15 and 
increases the share of the fee that is paid into the Securities Act Registration Fund by $10. 
While this could increase the available fund balance to use for these expanded purposes, it 
does not directly impact this provision.

Expand Allowable Uses of Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Business Account 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Requires, for fiscal 2026 through 2028 only, a total of $9.0 million 
each year from the Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Business Account (SMWOBA), 
specifically from previously unspent allocations under the current allocation distribution, 
to be made available to two other funds as follows:  $7.5 million to the Pre-Seed Builder 
Fund (Builder Fund) and $1.5 million to the Maryland Small Business Development 
Financing Authority (MSBDFA). The fiscal 2026 budget bill as passed by the 
General Assembly includes $9.0 million in general fund reductions for these two programs 
and $9.0 million in special fund appropriations, contingent on the enactment of legislation 
permitting the use of available SMWOBA funds.

State Effect:  The bill effectuates the contingent provisions in the fiscal 2026 budget and 
modifies funding for fiscal 2027 and 2028 as well. Accordingly, general fund expenditures 
decrease by $9.0 million annually from fiscal 2026 through 2028 due to the requirement 
for available SMWOBA special funds to be used to fund the two programs, and 
special fund expenditures for the Builder Fund ($7.5 million) and MSBDFA ($1.5 million) 
increase annually from fiscal 2026 through 2028. This analysis assumes that the SMWOBA 
funds made available through this provision continue to be used to replace, rather than 
supplement, general funds through fiscal 2028. Further, although some portion of the 
$27.0 million in SMWOBA funds could otherwise have been expended by SMWOBA, for 
no net effect on special fund expenditures, this analysis does not account for that possibility 
as the likelihood and timing for any such expenditures cannot be reliably predicted. Finally, 
SMWOBA revenues are unaffected as the funding must be from previous allocations 
(i.e., fund balance) rather than newly distributed revenues each year.  
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  SMWOBA, is used to provide loans and grants to small, minority, 
and women-owned businesses in the State. A small percentage of gross video lottery 
terminal proceeds is distributed to SMWOBA each fiscal year. Commerce then provides 
grants from SMWOBA to eligible fund managers – in practice, mostly a mixture of county

HB 352/ Page 134 
development corporations and private firms. The fund managers then provide loans and 
grants to small, minority, and women-owned businesses in the State. Generally, grants are 
limited to $10,000 per recipient and, except in the case of certain disasters or emergencies, 
must be issued in conjunction with a loan. The account historically has received more 
revenues each year than it provides via loans. 
 
The Builder Fund, a program in TEDCO, supports the development of start-up companies 
run by entrepreneurs from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds that hinder 
access to traditional forms of capital and executive networks at the pre-seed stage. 
 
MSBDFA provides financing services including contract financing, long-term guaranty, 
surety bonding, and equity participation investment to small businesses that have not been 
successful in obtaining assistance from traditional financing sources. 
 
Recent History:  None.

Expand Allowable Use of Program Open Space Funds for Fiscal 2026 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Authorizes the Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) to use an 
additional $340,000 of the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority’s (MHAA) Program Open 
Space (POS) funding allocation for MDP operating expenses in fiscal 2026 only. 
 
Agency:  MDP 
 
Type of Action:  Change use of special fund 
 
State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2026 only, special fund expenditures are 
unchanged but reallocated among uses. To the extent that an additional $340,000 is used 
for operating expenses in MDP, these funds are redirected from the MHAA Grant Program. 
The funds are intended to support the cost of procuring grant management software for the 
Maryland Historic Trust within MDP that year. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly does not assume general funds would have been used absent this 
special fund authorization. Nevertheless, if general funds might have been used for this 
purpose, general fund expenditures could decrease in fiscal 2026 only. Revenues are not 
affected. 
 
Local Effect:  Assuming an average grant amount of $46,800, this provision could result 
in as many as seven fewer MHAA grants being awarded to local governments and 
nonprofit organizations in fiscal 2026. According to MDP’s fiscal 2026 Managing for 
Results submission, MHAA grants have a 4:1 ratio for non-State investment leveraged. 
Thus, reducing the MHAA grant funding by $340,000 may result in the loss of up to 
$1.4 million in leveraged non-State funds. 
 
Program Description:  POS, administered by the Department of Natural Resources, 
provides funds for State and local conservation acquisitions and development of public 
outdoor recreational sites, facilities, and open space. POS is principally funded through 
special funds derived from the State’s property transfer tax. POS receives 75.15% of the 
total transfer tax revenues available for allocation, with further distribution of POS funds 
specified in statute. Up to $6.0 million of the total POS funds is allocated to the 
MHAA Financing Fund. Under current law, up to 10% of the POS funds allocated to 
MHAA may be used to pay MHAA operating expenses. 
 
MHAA was established in 1996 to foster heritage tourism by providing technical and 
financial assistance to create additional historic and cultural destinations within the State. 
Maryland’s 13 heritage areas are locally designated, and State certified, regions where 
public and private partners make commitments to preserving historical, cultural, and 
natural resources for sustainable economic development through heritage tourism. 
 
Recent History:  None.

remove a prohibition against WLEF supplanting funds for emergency community 
placements or transitioning students. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes a $15.0 million general fund reduction and a $15.0 million

State Effect:  General fund expenditures for the Developmental Disabilities 
Administration (DDA) decrease by $15.0 million in fiscal 2025, reflecting the reduction 
contingent on the enactment of this provision. Special fund expenditures increase 
correspondingly in fiscal 2025. To the extent the Governor uses this authorization in the 
future, general fund expenditures decrease, and special fund expenditures increase in a 
similar manner. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  DDA provides direct services to developmentally disabled 
individuals through the funding of a coordinated community-based service delivery system 
and in two State Residential Centers (SRCs) and a Secure Evaluation and Therapeutic 
Treatment unit, which shares a campus with one of the SRCs. 
 
WLEF was established to ensure that funding associated with individuals served in an SRC 
follows them when they are transitioned to a community-based care setting. MDH was 
required to adopt regulations for management and use of the funds. The funds are 
prohibited from being used to supplant funds for emergency community placements or 
transitioning youth. The primary ongoing source of revenue for WLEF is contributions 
through an income tax checkoff. WLEF may also receive funds appropriated in the 
State budget, which are equal to the cost of providing services to an individual in a SRC 
for a fiscal year or part of a year in which the individual is no longer served in a SRC and 
is provided community-based services, and any other source for the benefit of the fund. 
The fiscal 2024 closing balance for WLEF was $14,037,884.

Administration (DDA) within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) establishing a 
limit on the maximum dollar amount provided to recipients for individual-directed and 
family-directed goods and services (IFDGS) under the Community Services program. The

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund and federal fund expenditures 
decrease in fiscal 2026 by $14.5 million based on the level of reduction contingent on the 
enactment of this provision. Federal fund revenues decrease correspondingly. To the extent 
that DDA limits funding provided for IFDGS to individuals, general fund expenditures 
decrease in the out-years. This decrease is assumed to occur at the same level as the 
fiscal 2026 reduction. Corresponding federal fund revenues and expenditures claimed 
through the federal matching rate for Medicaid waivers are also reduced. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  DDA funds direct services to intellectually and developmentally 
disabled individuals through a coordinated community-based service delivery system. 
IFDGS are defined as services, equipment, activities, or supplies for individuals who 
self-direct services that (1) relate to a need or goal identified in the person-centered plan of 
service; (2) maintain or increase independence; (3) promote opportunities for community 
living and inclusion; and (4) are not available under another waiver provided under the 
State plan. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 736 and 737 of 2022 prohibit DDA from establishing a limit 
on the dollar amount of IFDGS provided to a recipient, but they also prohibit a recipient 
from receiving services or supports in excess of the recipient’s annual approved budget.

The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly added a total of $132.2 million 
in general funds and $15.0 million in special funds from the Community Services Trust 
Fund for the purpose of restoring and modifying various cost containment actions proposed 
for fiscal 2026. Of this funding, $7.0 million was added for the purpose of removing the 
day-to-day administrator category of services from IFDGS and placing the category on a 
separate service line.

State Effect:  General fund revenues increase by $22.7 million in fiscal 2025, reflecting 
the reversion, at the close of fiscal 2025, of unspent grant funds from fiscal 2024. The 
reversion is assumed in the fiscal 2026 budget plan as passed by the General Assembly. 
The provision allows for reversion of unexpended grant funds going forward as well. 
Accordingly, general fund expenditures decrease beginning in fiscal 2025 to the extent that 
unexpended funds from these entities are not retained by them. 
 
Local Effect:  Residual funding available to CSAs, LBHAs, and community providers 
from fiscal 2024 decreases by a combined $22.7 million; the allocation among jurisdictions 
and type of providers is unknown. Funding for CSAs, LBHAs, and community providers 
may further decrease by the amount of any unexpended dollars from BHA grants, at the 
close of each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal 2025. 
 
Program Description:  BHA distributes annual grants to CSAs, LBHAs, and community 
providers to support the provision of behavioral health services across the State. Under 
current law, MDH was required to develop a mechanism to ensure any unexpended funds 
remain with the grantee organizations at the end of each fiscal year.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures decrease by 
$3.1 million in fiscal 2026, reflecting the contingent appropriation (absent the authority to 
use SPDAP funding to deposit funds into health reimbursement accounts, additional 
general funds would be spent for that purpose). To the extent that the Governor chooses to 
spend SPDAP monies for this purpose beyond fiscal 2026, general fund expenditures 
decrease accordingly. Special fund expenditures increase in fiscal 2026, reflecting the 
contingent appropriation from the SPDAP Fund to the State Employee and Retiree Health 
Insurance Account within DBM. Beginning in fiscal 2027, special fund expenditures are 
neither increased nor decreased but may be reallocated among uses to the extent that the 
Governor chooses to spend SPDAP funding on this purpose. Special fund revenues are not 
affected.  
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  SPDAP provides Medicare Part D premium assistance to offset 
costs for moderate-income Maryland residents (with household incomes at or below 300% 
of federal poverty guidelines) who are eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in certain 
Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans. The program is supported with the SPDAP Fund, 
which is made up of payments from CareFirst equivalent to the value of its premium tax 
exemption. MDH anticipates the SPDAP Fund will close fiscal 2025 with a balance of 
$12.8 million, after transferring funding to other uses.

Chapter 397 of 2011 terminated prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible State 
retirees effective in fiscal 2020. Chapter 10 of 2018 made the termination effective 
January 1, 2019, with the expectation that Medicare-eligible State retirees could enroll in 
prescription drug coverage programs under Medicare Part D. Chapter 767 of 2019 
established reimbursement programs that cover out-of-pocket costs for retirees enrolled in 
Part D coverage. 
 
Recent History:  The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024 (Chapter 717) 
expanded allowable uses of the SPDAP Fund to include the Kidney Disease Program and 
community mental health services to the uninsured, beginning in fiscal 2025 (rather than

and support services. The Community Services Trust Fund includes an account that holds 
the proceeds from the sale or long-term lease of property and equipment resulting from the 
sale or long-term lease of DDA facilities. Under current law, the investment earnings from 
this account are transferred to the Waiting List Equity Fund.

general funds for infrastructure operations. (As the fiscal 2026 budget plan assumes a 
reversion of $2.0 million related to this provision, general fund savings of that magnitude 
are reflected above). Special fund expenditures are assumed to increase correspondingly.  
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Maryland Board of Nursing (MBON) within 
MDH is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the practice of nursing in the State, 
through licensure, certification, and education. In accordance with Chapters 222 and 223 
of 2023, authority for the MBON’s infrastructure and oversight operations was transferred 
to the MDH Office of the Secretary through June 30, 2025. Infrastructure operations refer 
to the administrative activities of a health occupations board or commission, including tools 
and resources for the use and support of deliberative action. Chapters 222 and 223 also 
prohibited the use of special funds from the Board of Nursing Fund to pay for infrastructure 
operations while the Office of the Secretary retains authority. 
 
Chapter 416 of 2025 extends MDH’s authority over the board’s infrastructure and human 
resources operations for an additional five years through June 30, 2030, after which 
authority reverts to MBON. However, Chapter 416 also repeals the prohibition against the 
Board of Nursing Fund being used to pay for infrastructure operations while the Secretary 
retains authority, effective June 1, 2025. Accordingly, the fiscal and policy note for that 
legislation assumed a one-month effect on special fund expenditures (an increase of 
$440,000) for fiscal 2025, it did not account for the general fund reversion. 
 
At the close of fiscal 2024, the special fund balance for MBON was $1.8 million.

Limit Restoration of Benefits Lost Due to Electronic Benefits Transfer Card Theft  
 
Provision in the Bill:  Limits, beginning in fiscal 2025, the total amount of benefits 
restored by the Department of Human Services (DHS) for Electronic Benefits Transfer 
(EBT) card theft to $30.0 million per fiscal year. 
 
Agency:  DHS 
 
Type of Action:  Cost containment 
 
State Effect:  There is no anticipated impact, as expenditures to restore benefits lost due 
to EBT card theft have historically been significantly lower than the $30.0 million per 
fiscal year limitation specified in the provision. For instance, during the first eight months 
of fiscal 2025, a total of $8.7 million in benefits was restored. To the extent, however, that 
a substantial increase in theft activity related to EBT cards occurs in future years, 
general fund expenditures that may have otherwise been required to fully restore stolen 
benefits are avoided due to the $30.0 million limit per fiscal year. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapters 171 and 172 of 2023 established an EBT 
card theft restoration program in DHS, generally requiring DHS to restore Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and cash benefits (e.g., Temporary Cash Assistance) 
lost due to EBT card theft. The federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 authorized 
states to use federal funds to replace SNAP benefits stolen through card skimming, card 
cloning, and other fraudulent methods between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2024. 
The authorization was subsequently extended to be applicable to benefits stolen through 
December 20, 2024.

Expand Allowable Uses of Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund to 
Support Department of Natural Resources Operating Expenses 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands allowable uses of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal 
Bays 2010 Trust Fund to support up to $10.5 million of Department of Natural Resources 
(DNR) operating expenses in the annual budget bill. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by 
the General Assembly includes (1) for fiscal 2025, a $2.6 million general fund reduction 
and $2.6 million special fund appropriation and (2) for fiscal 2026, a series of general fund 
reductions totaling $10.5 million and a series of special fund appropriations totaling 
$10.5 million. All of these actions are contingent on the enactment of legislation allowing 
the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund to support operating expenses 
in DNR.

State Effect:  The provision specifies that up to $10.5 million of the Chesapeake and 
Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund in the annual budget bill may be used for operating 
expenses in DNR. This analysis assumes the provision applies beginning in fiscal 2025. 
Therefore, general fund expenditures decrease by $2.6 million in fiscal 2025 and 
$10.5 million in fiscal 2026 reflecting the contingent reductions, and special fund 
expenditures increase correspondingly. This analysis assumes the authorization continues 
to be used; thus, out-year general fund expenditures decrease by as much as $10.5 million 
and special fund expenditures increase correspondingly. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  Funding for local projects from the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 
2010 Trust Fund may decrease beginning in fiscal 2025 as a result of funds being used to 
support DNR operating expenses. The Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust 
Fund’s fiscal 2025 appropriation is $77.1 million, of which $35.9 million, or approximately 
46%, is allocated to the Competitive Grant Program for local projects. The Chesapeake and 
Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund’s fiscal 2026 appropriation is $90.7 million, of 
which $35.7 million, or approximately 39%, is allocated to the Competitive Grant Program 
for local projects. 
 
Program Description:  Chapter 6 of the 2007 special session established a Chesapeake 
and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund to be used to implement the State’s tributary

restoration strategy. The fund is financed with a portion of existing revenues from the 
motor fuel tax and the sales and use tax on short-term vehicle rentals. Subsequently, 
Chapters 120 and 121 of 2008 established a framework for how the trust fund money must 
be spent by specifying that it be used for nonpoint source pollution control projects and by 
expanding it to apply to the Atlantic Coastal Bays. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 717 of 2024 (Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024) 
establishes that $2.5 million in special funds from the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal 
Bays 2010 Trust Fund must be used annually from fiscal 2024 through 2031 for 
tree plantings on public and private land. Chapters 558 and 559 of 2024 authorized the use 
of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund as a revenue source for the 
Whole Watershed Fund created by the legislation and required that in each fiscal year from 
fiscal 2026 through 2030, inclusive, up to $100,000 from the fund be used to fund the 
operations grants for approved Whole Watershed Fund projects.

marine operations of the Natural Resources Police by $100,000 from $2.0 million to 
$2.1 million beginning in fiscal 2026. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund expenditures increase by $100,000 
in fiscal 2026 and as much as $100,000 annually thereafter. Accordingly, while reliance on 
the general fund may be mitigated, this analysis assumes that this funding would not have 
otherwise been expended. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The provisions establishing and governing the Waterway 
Improvement Fund are contained within the State Boat Act. Financial support for the fund 
is derived from the 5% excise tax on the sale of vessels in the State and 0.5% of the 
motor vehicle fuel tax. The Waterway Improvement Fund finances projects and activities 
that promote, develop, and maintain Maryland’s waterways for the benefit of the boating 
public. DNR may propose up to a $2.0 million annual appropriation from the Waterway 
Improvement Fund to support marine operations of the Natural Resources Police. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 560 of 2024 requires, beginning in fiscal 2026, DNR to distribute 
at least $250,000 annually from the Waterway Improvement Fund to a qualifying statewide 
Maryland-based historic preservation nonprofit organization to establish, operate, and 
administer a maritime heritage competitive grant program. 
 
Accounting for this provision, the Waterway Improvement Fund is projected to have a 
closing fund balance of $17.6 million in fiscal 2026.

Waive, Temporarily, Requirement to Specify Across-the-board Reductions 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Waives, for fiscal 2026 only, the requirements that the Governor 
specify how expenditure reductions in the budget bill will be achieved and identify  
across-the-board reductions at a minimum level of detail and instead authorizes the 
Governor to provide this detail. 
 
Agency:  Multiple 
 
Type of Action:  Cost containment; miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Although the provision itself does not have a 
fiscal effect, the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly assumes 
$50.0 million in general fund savings from efforts to modernize and find efficiencies in 
government. The savings are from undetermined agencies and purposes as these savings 
are to be determined through work from a consultant that will identify the savings 
opportunities. Absent this change, this unspecified decrease would not be allowable under 
statute. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) prepares the 
Governor’s annual budget allowance in accordance with various statutes and regulations, 
including § 7-114.2 of the State Finance and Procurement Article which disallows  
across-the-board reductions unless the reductions are specified for each affected agency at 
a certain level of detail. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
a $50.0 million general fund across-the-board reduction that has yet to be specified at an 
agency level or at the appropriate level of detail. 
 
Recent History:  The Board of Public Works approved a pay-for-performance contract 
between DBM and Boston Consulting to identify and implement initiatives intended to 
improve operational efficiency in the delivery of government services over a 
two-year period. DBM estimates that the project could yield $75.0 million in savings with 
a maximum pay-for-performance expenditure of $15.0 million in general funds dependent 
on the level of savings identified by the vendor.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures increase by 
$15.0 million in fiscal 2026 as a general fund appropriation under Medicaid is needed to 
offset the reduced CRF funding for Medicaid. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes a $15.0 million general fund appropriation for Medicaid. CRF 
revenues and expenditures are not affected since funds are reallocated among eligible uses 
in fiscal 2026 ($15.0 million is reallocated for the Statewide Academic Health Center 
cancer research grants). The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly 
includes a total CRF appropriation of $104.0 million. Of this amount, support for Medicaid 
expenses (after a $15.0 million reduction of CRF to restore funding for the Statewide 
Academic Health Center cancer research grants) accounts for 15.7%, or $16.3 million. By 
temporarily waiving the percentage allocation, the provision ensures budgetary actions 
comply with statutory requirements. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  CRF, established by Chapters 172 and 173 of 
1999, is a special fund supported by payments made by tobacco manufacturers under the 
Master Settlement Agreement. CRF uses are restricted by § 7-317 of the State Finance and 
Procurement Article, including the requirement that at least 30% of the annual 
appropriation must be used for Medicaid. Another requirement is that at least 50% of the 
annual CRF appropriation must support certain activities (mainly health-related programs) 
that are specified in statute. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly 
meets this second requirement with 50.5% of the CRF appropriation supporting the 
specified activities. 
 
As introduced, the BRFA of 2025 would have eliminated the mandate to fund Statewide 
Academic Health Centers with $13.0 million of CRF. This provision was struck by the 
General Assembly. In addition to the restored funding, Section 21 of the fiscal 2026 budget 

END OF PAGE 152

START OF PAGE 153
HB 352/ Page 153 
adds another $2.0 million of CRF monies for this purpose, to level fund the grants with 
fiscal 2025. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a 
$15.0 million reduction in special funds from Medicaid to support the reallocation. The 
special fund reduction under Medicaid is backfilled with a $15.0 million general fund 
appropriation to fully fund Medicaid at the level of expected expenditures.

enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) that are placed in a separate 
account within the Cigarette Restitution Fund (CRF) to support Medicaid expenses in 
fiscal 2026 only. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a

authorizing the use of funds received from litigation related to the enforcement of MSA to 
support Medicaid expenses.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. No effect on overall special fund expenditures 
from CRF, but monies received from litigation are reallocated from making settlement 
payments to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in fiscal 2027 to instead 
supporting Medicaid expenses in fiscal 2026. General fund expenditures for Medicaid 
decrease by $25.0 million in fiscal 2026, contingent on the enactment of this provision, in 
recognition of available CRF monies from the separate account to cover expenses. 
General fund expenditures increase by $25.0 million for HBCU settlement payments in 
fiscal 2027 due to the reduced availability of CRF monies for that purpose. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  CRF, established by Chapters 172 and 173 of 1999, is a 
special fund supported by payments made by tobacco manufacturers under MSA. 
Chapters 41 and 42 of 2021 require payments received by the State as a result of litigation 
related to Maryland’s enforcement of State law regarding MSA to go into a separate 
account that may only be used to support settlement payments to HBCUs, which are 
otherwise general fund expenditures. 
 
Recent History:  An arbitration hearing to determine Maryland’s settlements and diligent 
enforcement of qualifying statute in sales year 2005 through 2007 occurred in March 2023. 
On November 20, 2023, the Office of the Attorney General announced that the panel of 
three arbitrators unanimously decided in favor of Maryland and that the State is likely to

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund expenditures increase by $1.4 million 
in fiscal 2026 as this provision effectuates a contingent appropriation in the fiscal 2026 
budget as passed by the General Assembly. In particular, language in Supplemental Budget 
No. 1 makes the Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices Settlement Fund the fund source for a 
$1.4 million special fund appropriation for access to counsel. To the extent that the 
Governor chooses to use this source for expenditures for legal assistance for evictions or 
other legal assistance in the future, special fund expenditures may be reallocated from other 
purposes. To the extent that these funds are used to replace general fund expenditures in 
those years, general fund expenditures decrease. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices 
Settlement Fund provides funding for housing counseling, legal assistance related to 
foreclosure and housing, fraud investigations related to housing and mortgage loans, 
enforcement activities, and other public purposes related to housing and foreclosure relief. 
The fund’s revenues are from judgments against or settlements with bank mortgage 
servicers or other parties in the mortgage servicing industry. As of March 10, 2025, the 
balance of the fund was approximately $14.9 million. 
 
A separate provision in this bill authorizes a transfer of $5.0 million from the fund to the 
general fund in fiscal 2025.

Waive, Temporarily, Requirement that Opioid Restitution Fund Monies Supplement 
Other Funding 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Waives, in fiscal 2025 and 2026 only, the requirement that the 
Opioid Restitution Fund (ORF) be supplemental to and not supplant funds otherwise 
provided for programs and services. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes, in fiscal 2025, general fund reductions and special fund 
appropriations each totaling $2,965,667 in the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) 
Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) and $5,000,000 in the Department of Public 
Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) and, in fiscal 2026, general fund reductions and 
special fund appropriations each totaling $2,430,383 in BHA and $5,000,000 in DPSCS, 
all contingent on the enactment of legislation allowing the use of ORF to supplant funding.

State Effect:  Combined special fund expenditures from ORF increase by $8.0 million in 
fiscal 2025 and $7.4 million in fiscal 2026, reflecting contingent appropriations. 
General fund expenditures decrease correspondingly. In fiscal 2025 and 2026, these ORF 
monies are to support the Buprenorphine Initiative in BHA ($3.0 million in fiscal 2025 and 
$2.4 million in fiscal 2026) and to support, within DPSCS, medication for the treatment of 
opioid use disorder for inmates at two State correctional facilities ($2.5 million for Jessup 
Correctional Institution and $2.5 million for Eastern Correctional Institution each year), 
which would not otherwise be eligible uses of ORF. Special fund expenditures on activities 
that do not supplant existing funding decrease as early as fiscal 2026 as the funds are no 
longer available to expand services; amounts in any particular year are unknown and, thus, 
are not reflected above. 
 
Local Effect:  To the extent that ORF would have otherwise been used to support grants 
to local organizations, grant funds are potentially reduced, though the amount and timing 
of any potential decrease cannot be reliably estimated. ORF distributions to local 
governments in accordance with settlement term requirements are not affected. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 537 of 2019 established ORF, a 
special fund to retain any revenues received by the State relating to specified opioid 
judgments or settlements, which may be used only for opioid-related programs and

services. Chapter 537 required that this funding be used to supplement, rather than 
supplant, funding otherwise appropriated for relevant services and programs to address the 
opioid crisis. Chapter 270 of 2022 further expanded the uses of ORF. The ORF Advisory 
Council publishes spending recommendations annually. The Maryland Office of Overdose 
Response distributes grant funding to local governments and local organizations in 
accordance with settlement term requirements and State law, and in alignment with ORF 
Advisory Council recommendations.

Require Local Cost Share for Individuals Erroneously Convicted, Sentenced, and 
Confined Under State Law 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require that the county government in which the conviction of an 
individual occurred must pay to the State 50% of the amount of compensation awarded to 
an individual under § 10-501(a)(1) of the State Finance and Procurement Article for being 
convicted, sentenced, and confined under State law for a crime the individual did not 
commit. Apply the requirement to new awards beginning in fiscal 2026. Maintain (as under 
current law) the formula for compensation awarded under § 10-501(a)(1) such that it is 
equal to the product of the total number of days that the individual was wrongfully confined 
after the erroneous conviction multiplied by a daily rate of the State’s most recent annual 
median household income, as specified. Require counties to annually remit their full share 
of payments for the fiscal year to the Comptroller by June 30. Require the Board of Public 
Works (BPW) to periodically notify the Comptroller and each county of their share of each 
erroneous conviction award during the fiscal year – specifically on October 1, December 1, 
March 1, and June 1. Authorize the Comptroller to withhold a portion of a local income 
tax distribution of a county that fails to make a timely payment.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Under one set of assumptions, general fund 
revenues increase by $750,000 in fiscal 2026, $1.5 million in fiscal 2027, and $2.3 million 
annually thereafter. These amounts reflect projected revenues from the local share (50%) 
that are based on the average payment per person per year between fiscal 2022 and 2024 
(approximately $380,000), assume four new grantees each year (with payments over 
multiple years), and assume stabilized awards payments subject to reimbursement 
beginning in fiscal 2028. Although this estimate is based on the aforementioned 
assumptions, the Department of Legislative Services notes that the number and monetary 
value of awards vary by year. For example, BPW advises that administrative law judges 
issued five orders for compensation in fiscal 2024; the compensation associated with those 
petitions is approximately $8.8 million, and the average projected time to complete 
payments for these awards is 1.8 years. There was also a related settlement of an appeal for 
approximately $226,700. In fiscal 2023, administrative law judges issued four new orders 
with compensation of $5.7 million, including attorney’s fees, which are not subject to local 
reimbursement.

State for compensation, subject to specified procedures. Individuals must file petitions with 
the Office of Administrative Hearings, administrative law judges are responsible for 
issuing orders to grant petitions, and BPW is responsible for making payments. If an 
administrative law judge orders that an individual is eligible for compensation and benefits 
in accordance with State law, the order must include the monetary award described above, 
reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses associated with the action, benefits that may be 
awarded under State law, and a recommendation for an expedited payment schedule if the 
judge determines it is in the interests of the individual. The additional benefits that may be 
included in the order include a State identification card; housing accommodations for up 
to five years; health care and dental care for up to five years; vocational training; 
reimbursement for court fines, fees, and restitution paid by the individual; and higher 
education tuition and fees. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 138 and 139 of 2024 (1) extended eligibility to receive 
compensation to individuals erroneously convicted, sentenced, and confined for conspiracy 
to commit a felony; (2) altered the benefits available to individuals; (3) required the State 
to notify an individual in writing if the State intends to introduce certain evidence to reduce 
or prevent an award of compensation; and (4) repealed obsolete provisions.

Swap Funding for Bus Rapid Transit Fund and Alter Grant Requirements 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Reduce the mandated distribution of lottery revenues to the 
Bus Rapid Transit Fund (BRTF) from $27.0 million annually to $17.0 million annually 
beginning in fiscal 2026. Require the Governor to include in the State budget an 
appropriation of $10.0 million annually from the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) to BRTF 
for bus rapid transit (BRT) grants beginning in fiscal 2026. Increase the amount of funding 
that must be provided to Montgomery County from BRTF from $20.0 million to 
$25.0 million if there are two eligible grantees and one of the two is Montgomery County. 
Clarify that BRTF may be used to make funding commitments for the issuance of 
BRT bonds.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by $10.0 million 
annually beginning in fiscal 2026; TTF expenditures increase correspondingly. 
 
Local Effect:  Total funding provided to local governments from BRTF is not affected; 
however, if there are two eligible grantees in future fiscal years, Montgomery County will 
receive more funding compared to current law. 
 
Program Description:  BRTF is a special fund administered by MDOT, the purpose of 
which is to provide grants to eligible grantees. An “eligible grantee” is a county or 
municipality that has a BRT system that operates in the county or municipality and has no 
ongoing or completed facility. BRTF consists primarily of State lottery revenues. Eligible 
grantees receiving funds from BRTF may use the grant funds for the financing and 
refinancing of specified BRT system costs, payment of debt service on bonds issued to 
finance BRT system projects, payment of all reasonable expenses and charges related to 
bond issuance and borrowing, and payment of costs relating to the management and 
operation of BRT system projects. If there is only one eligible grantee, MDOT must award 
a grant to the eligible grantee equal to the amount distributed to MDOT from State lottery 
revenues. If there is more than one eligible grantee, statute establishes conditions regarding 
the distribution of funds among eligible grantees. Among other things, if there are 
two eligible grantees, and one eligible grantee is Montgomery County, MDOT must

distribute $20.0 million to Montgomery County and the remaining amount to the remaining 
eligible grantee. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 112 of 2023 initially established BRTF and required the transfer 
of up to $27.0 million of State lottery funds to the special fund based on specified deposits 
for Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA) debt service. Chapter 483 of 2024 required the 
transfer of an amount equal to $27.0 million of State lottery funds to BRTF (instead of an 
amount of up to $27.0 million based on specified deposits for MSA debt service).

Expand Allowable Uses of Maryland Strategic Energy Investment Fund  
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands the allowable uses of the Strategic Energy Investment 
Fund (SEIF) to include costs associated with the Maryland Department of Environment’s 
(MDE) Air and Radiation Administration. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes a $6,069,452 general fund reduction and $6,069,452 
special fund appropriation for fiscal 2026 and a $6,565,333 general fund reduction and 
$6,565,333 special fund appropriation for fiscal 2025, each contingent on legislation to 
allow Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) auction revenues deposited into SEIF to 
be used for general expenses within the Air and Radiation Administration.

State Effect:  General fund expenditures for MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration 
decrease by $6.6 million in fiscal 2025 and $6.1 million in fiscal 2026, and special fund 
expenditures increase commensurately, due to the contingent reductions and appropriations 
effectuated by this provision. Assuming the Governor chooses to use SEIF as authorized 
under this provision in future years, general fund expenditures decrease, and special fund 
expenditures increase by similar amounts. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  Beginning as early as fiscal 2026, local governments may receive less 
funding from SEIF-funded programs. Amounts, if any, in any particular year are unknown. 
 
Program Description:  Chapters 127 and 128 of 2008 created the Maryland Strategic 
Energy Investment Program and the implementing SEIF to decrease energy demand and 
increase energy supply to promote affordable, reliable, and clean energy. SEIF is primarily 
funded through the proceeds from the auction of carbon allowances under RGGI; the fund 
also receives revenues from compliance fees – often referred to as Renewable Portfolio 
Standard alternative compliance payments (ACPs) – generated under the State’s 
Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard. Although not required under statute, SEIF has held 
funds from various settlement agreements and orders related to Public Service Commission 
utility cases. 
 
RGGI proceeds must be used for the following purposes:  (1) at least 50% for 
energy assistance programs in the Department of Human Services; (2) at least 20% for 

END OF PAGE 163

START OF PAGE 164
HB 352/ Page 164 
energy efficiency and conservation (at least one-half of which must be used for low- and 
moderate-income programs); (3) at least 20% for renewable and clean energy programs, 
energy-related education and outreach, and climate change and resiliency programs; and 
(4) up to 10% but no more than $7.5 million for administrative expenses. Generally, 
ACP revenues may be used only to make loans and grants to support the creation of new 
renewable energy sources in the State that are owned by or directly benefit specified 
communities, households, or businesses. 
 
Currently, MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration has received and expended SEIF for 
climate change activities and the paying of Maryland’s share of RGGI dues. In fiscal 2024, 
these expenditures totaled $3.55 million. Prior to the proposed deficiency appropriation, 
the fiscal 2025 working appropriation provided $4.28 million in SEIF monies for these 
purposes. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 98 of 2023 increased the dollar cap on the amount of RGGI 
Program revenues that may be credited to the Administration subaccount within SEIF from 
$5.0 million to $7.5 million, along with modifying two transportation sector programs 
funded by SEIF and modifying the authorized uses of certain ACPs deposited in SEIF. 
 
The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act (BRFA) of 2024 (Chapter 717) authorized 
the transfer of $90.0 million from the SEIF balance to the Dedicated Purpose Account in 
fiscal 2025 to be used to help implement the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 and 
Maryland’s Climate Pollution Reduction Plan and required at least 50% of funds be 
transferred to support programs serving low- to moderate-income communities. 
 
Other provisions in the BRFA of 2025 redirect SEIF interest and investment earnings to 
the general fund and authorize a transfer of fund balance from the ACP sub-account of 
SEIF to the general fund. These provisions are discussed elsewhere in this fiscal and policy 
note.

Expand Authorized Uses of Alternative Compliance Payment Revenues in Fiscal 2026 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands, in fiscal 2026 only, the allowable uses of Alternative 
Compliance Payment (ACP) revenues in the Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) to 
include up to $100.0 million for solar development on State government property and local 
government clean energy programs, which must be accounted for separately within the 
fund. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $50.0 million 
special fund appropriation for the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) and a 
$50.0 million special fund appropriation for the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), 
both contingent on the enactment of legislation expanding the use of ACP revenues in SEIF 
in fiscal 2026 only.

not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  Local governments may benefit from $50.0 million of ACP funding in MEA 
being used for local government renewable energy projects. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Maryland’s renewable energy portfolio standard 
(RPS) requires that a specified portion of retail electricity sold in the State each year come 
from renewable sources, as defined. To demonstrate compliance with RPS requirements, 
electricity suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to the percentage specified 
in statute each year or else pay an ACP equivalent to their shortfall. ACPs are paid into 
SEIF, which is administered by MEA. Generally, ACP revenues may be used only to make 
loans and grants to support the creation of new renewable energy sources in the State that 
are owned by or directly benefit specified communities, households, or businesses. The 
loans and grants made from solar, and post-2022 geothermal ACP revenues must be for 
specified purposes related to solar and geothermal energy, including for the  
Customer-sited Solar Program from fiscal 2025 through 2027. Additionally, through 
June 30, 2027, MEA may use up to 10% of solar ACP revenues for administrative 
expenses.

Supplemental Budget No. 1 added $50.0 million in special fund appropriations from ACP 
revenues in SEIF to both MDOT and MEA. The funds in MDOT are to be used for 
implementation of the State’s Climate Pollution Reduction Plan, and the funds in MEA are 
to be used for local government renewable energy projects. Absent this provision, these 
activities would not be an allowable use of the funds as the projects do not directly benefit 
low- to moderate-income communities, low- to moderate-income households, or 
overburdened or underserved communities.

Expand Use of Performance Incentive Grant Fund to Support Office of Correctional 
Ombudsman Operations 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Authorizes, beginning in fiscal 2026, the use of up to $1.0 million 
each year from the Performance Incentive Grant Fund to be used for operations of the 
Office of the Correctional Ombudsman (OCO). The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes a $1.0 million general fund reduction and a corresponding 
$1.0 million special fund appropriation under OCO, contingent on the enactment of 
legislation authorizing the use of the Performance Incentive Grant Fund for OCO 
operations.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund expenditures increase for OCO by 
$1.0 million and general fund expenditures decrease correspondingly in fiscal 2026, 
reflecting the contingent appropriation and contingent reduction. Assuming the maximum 
allowable funding for OCO operations continues to be used, general fund expenditures also 
decrease by $1.0 million in fiscal 2027 and annually thereafter. However, beginning in 
fiscal 2027, net special fund expenditures are not affected, merely reallocated among 
purposes. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Performance Incentive Grant Fund within 
GOCPP is intended to make use of the savings from the implementation of Chapter 515 
of 2016, the Justice Reinvestment Act, to provide grants for specified programs and 
services, including providing for pretrial risk assessments, services to reduce pretrial 
detention, diversion programs, specialty courts, reentry programs, and ensuring that the 
rights of crime victims are protected and enhanced. Money expended from the fund for 
programs to reduce recidivism and control correctional costs is supplemental to and is not 
intended to take the place of funding that otherwise would be appropriated for such 
purposes. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
$11.2 million for the fund.

The fiscal 2025 budget included $1.0 million in special fund expenditures from the 
Performance Incentive Grant Fund for OCO, contingent on the enactment of Chapter 836 
of 2024. Chapter 836 established OCO as an independent oversight entity with the power 
to conduct reviews and investigations of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional 
Services and the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS). OCO has the authority to 
subpoena individuals as well as refer certain matters for disciplinary proceedings or 
criminal charges. Chapter 836 also transferred the Juvenile Justice Monitoring unit, which 
investigates the needs of children under DJS jurisdiction, from the Office of the 
Attorney General to OCO. Chapter 836 authorized, for fiscal 2025 only, Performance 
Incentive Grant Funds to be distributed to OCO.

Provisions in the Bill:  Reduce the participation target for the Maryland Corps Young 
Adult (YA) Service Year Option Pathway in fiscal 2027 by 500 and establish participation 
targets for fiscal 2026 and 2028. Reduce, only for fiscal 2026, the mandated appropriation 
to the Maryland Service Year (MSY) Option Pathway Fund from $15.0 million to 
$13.0 million. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
expenditure reductions of $6.8 million in general funds and $5.3 million in special funds, 
contingent on the enactment of legislation reducing the mandate for the MSY Pathway 
Fund in fiscal 2026 and reducing the YA Service Pathway participation in fiscal 2026 from 
1,000 to 750.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Assuming that this provision effectuates the 
contingent reductions in the budget bill, general fund expenditures decrease by $6.8 million 
in fiscal 2026. Assuming the mandated general fund appropriation would otherwise be 
deposited in full to the MSY Pathway Fund and discretionary general funds would have 
been deposited to the YA Service Pathway Fund, special fund revenues decrease 
correspondingly. Special fund expenditures decrease by $5.3 million reflecting the 
contingent reduction in the budget bill. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapter 99 of 2023 (the SERVE Act) established the YA and MSY 
pathways of the Maryland Corps Program. Statutory targets for the YA pathway are 200 in 
the first year (fiscal 2024) and 2,000 in the fourth year (fiscal 2027) of implementation. 
However, current law does not include targets for other years of implementation, including 
the referenced target of 1,000 in the third year of implementation (fiscal 2026). Current 
law requires an appropriation to the MSY Pathway Fund of $15.0 million in fiscal 2026 
and $20.0 million annually beginning in fiscal 2027. The provision makes no changes to 
the out-year mandated funding levels. 
 

END OF PAGE 169

START OF PAGE 170
HB 352/ Page 170 
As noted above, this analysis assumes that this provision effectuates the contingent 
expenditure reductions in the budget bill. The reductions are contingent on legislation that 
reduces the YA participation target for fiscal 2026, but there is no target established in 
current law for fiscal 2026 (and, therefore, no target to reduce). If it is determined that this 
provision does not effectuate those reductions, the only effect is a $2.0 million general fund 
reduction to the MSY Pathway Fund and a corresponding reduction in special fund 
revenues. 
 
Recent History:  None.

$27.1 million annually in fiscal 2029 through 2038 due to repayment of the transfers. (The 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly assumes $270.6 million in 
revenues.) Expenditures are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Comptroller’s Office uses the LITR Account 
to manage the cash flow of personal income tax payments and distributions to 
local governments. The account is also used to meet the State’s liability for local income 
taxes according to generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
The State has transferred from this account to support general fund spending and other 
specified spending on several occasions in recent years. Chapter 484 of 2010 required the 
Comptroller to distribute $350.0 million from the LITR Account to the Education Trust 
Fund, which was one of several transfers made from the account in that and other years. 
Although Chapter 484 established a repayment plan for fiscal 2014 through 2020, 
Chapter 425 of 2013 repealed the repayment plan. Chapter 489 of 2015 established a 
repayment of $10.0 million from fiscal 2016 through 2025 for another $100.0 million 
transfer authorized in that Act. Chapter 10 of 2018 extended the $10.0 million annual 
repayment indefinitely and no longer tied the repayment to any particular transfer. 
Chapter 717 of 2024 repealed the requirement for the annual $10.0 million distribution to 
the LITR Account in fiscal 2024 and 2025 and specified that, from fiscal 2026 through 
2060, the annual $10.0 million distribution to the LITR Account is to repay $350.0 million

in fiscal 2029, but potentially as early as fiscal 2027, due to repayment of the transfer within 
two years after FAMLI contributions commence. (The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly assumes $37.3 million in revenues.)

Program Description/Recent History:  The Comptroller’s Office uses the LITR Account 
to manage the cash flow of personal income tax payments and distributions to

Chapter 717 of 2024 repealed the requirement for the annual $10.0 million distribution to 
the LITR Account in fiscal 2024 and 2025 and specified that, from fiscal 2026 through 

END OF PAGE 173

HB 352/ Page 174 
2060, the annual $10.0 million distribution to the LITR Account is to repay $350.0 million 
transferred from the account to the Education Trust Fund as required in Chapter 484 
of 2010. Accordingly, Chapter 717 terminated that distribution to the LITR Account after 
fiscal 2060 when that repayment is complete. 
 
Chapter 48 of 2022 established the FAMLI Program. The program generally provides up 
to 12 weeks of benefits to a covered individual who is taking leave from employment due 
to caring for or bonding with certain family members, the individual’s own serious health 
condition, or a qualifying exigency arising out of a family member’s military deployment. 
The weekly benefit is based on an individual’s average weekly wage and is indexed to 
inflation. Required contributions to the program, which are shared between employers and 
employees, are based on employee wages and are to be paid into the FAMLI Fund, a 
special fund, to carry out the program. The program has been delayed, and Chapter 363 of 
2025 further delays the program’s start dates.  
 
Under Chapter 363, employer and employee contributions to the program begin 18 months 
later, on January 1, 2027, and claims for benefits begin at least 6 months later, on a date 
after January 1, 2027, but not later than January 3, 2028, as determined and announced by 
the Secretary of Labor. The delay in FAMLI contributions means that FAMLI Fund 
revenues are not available to support the program. The fiscal and policy note for 
Chapter 363 estimates general fund expenditures for MD Labor increase by $37.3 million 
in fiscal 2026 to fund existing personnel, contracts, and related FAMLI expenses that 
cannot be deferred; the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a 
contingent $37.3 million general fund appropriation, effectuated by that legislation. The 
general fund revenues realized by this provision fully fund that contingent appropriation.

Redirect Land Preservation Funding to General Fund 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Redirect $25.0 million in transfer tax revenue to the general fund 
for fiscal 2026 through 2029 from the following State land preservation programs:  
Program Open Space (POS) State land acquisition; Rural Legacy Program in the 
Department of Natural Resources (DNR); and Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation 
Program in the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA). Allocate the amount 
transferred annually proportionally to estimated revenues received by those 
three programs. Specify that existing provisions requiring reimbursement do not apply to 
the transfers. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes 
special fund reductions of $9,979,342 in the Rural Legacy Program and $15,020,658 in the 
Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program, contingent on the enactment of these 
provisions.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by $25.0 million 
in fiscal 2026 through 2029 due to the redirection of funding attributable to allocations for 
land preservation programs to the general fund. Special fund revenues and expenditures 
decrease by an equivalent amount. The fiscal 2026 actual and fiscal 2027 through 2029 
estimated redirections by program are shown in Exhibit 1.

Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The State transfer tax, which is 0.5% of the amount paid for the 
transfer of real property, is used to fund POS, along with several land conservation 
programs and State forest and park operations. DNR administers POS, which acquires and 
improves outdoor recreation and open space areas for public use. POS consists of a State 
and local component. Transfer tax funding distributed to POS is allocated by the following 
approximate percentages and amounts:  (1) 50% to State land acquisition, of which 
$8.0 million is authorized to be used for the Rural Legacy Program and $10.0 million is 
authorized for the Baltimore City Direct Grant and capital development; (2) 30% is 
allocated to local government acquisition and development; and (3) 20% is allocated to 
State forest and park operations. In addition, transfer tax funding is used to fund the 
Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program, administered by MDA, and to provide 
a second allocation to the Rural Legacy Program. 
 
Recent History:  The POS State land acquisition balance has been used a number of times 
to help defray State budget shortfalls or otherwise limit the need for the use of State 
general funds. Chapter 39 of 2022 (Great Maryland Outdoors Act) authorized the 
Governor, on or before June 30, 2022, to transfer $43.1 million of the funds for POS State 
land acquisition in the transfer tax special fund to the Park System Capital Improvements 
and Acquisition Fund created by Chapter 39, which obviated the need for $43.1 million in 
State general funds for this purpose. 
 
Chapter 717 of 2024 (Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024) authorized the 
Governor to transfer up to $6,678,827 of available special funds from the POS State land 
acquisition fund balance by June 30, 2025, to DNR to replace general funds budgeted for 
personnel expenses in DNR for the Maryland Forest Service and Maryland Park Service. 
 
A separate provision in the bill authorizes up to $16.4 million from the POS land 
acquisition fund balance to be used for Maryland Park Service operating expenses in DNR 
in fiscal 2026 only.

Expand Allowable Use of Maryland Emergency Medical System Operations Fund to 
Support Maryland State Police Aviation Command 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands the allowable uses of the Maryland Emergency Medical 
System Operations Fund (MEMSOF), in fiscal 2025 and 2026 only, to allow the fund to 
support general operations of the Maryland State Police Aviation Command (MSPAC). 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $5.5 million 
general fund reduction and a $5.5 million special fund appropriation for both fiscal 2025 
and 2026, contingent on legislation expanding the allowable uses of MEMSOF.

State Effect:  MEMSOF supports approximately 80.0% of MSPAC’s expenditures each 
fiscal year, representing the share of MSPAC’s functions that are medically oriented. Since 
this provision does not establish a limit on the amount of MEMSOF that could be used to 
support general operations of MSPAC, general fund expenditures for DSP are assumed to 
decrease by $5.5 million in fiscal 2025 and 2026, reflecting the level of reduction 
contingent on the enactment of this provision. Special fund expenditures increase 
correspondingly. Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MEMSOF consists of (1) vehicle registration surcharges; (2) all 
funds, including charges for accident scene transports and interhospital transfers of 
patients, generated by specified units of State government; and (3) revenue distributed from 
a $7.50 moving violation surcharge. Money from MEMSOF must be used solely for 
(1) medically oriented functions of MSPAC; (2) Maryland Institute for Emergency 
Medical Services Systems; (3) R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center; (4) the Maryland 
Fire and Rescue Institute; (5) local grants under the Senator William H. Amoss Fire, 
Rescue, and Ambulance Fund (Amoss Fund); and (6) the Volunteer Company Assistance 
Fund. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 717, 718, and 719 of 2024 increased the annual surcharge on 
motor vehicle registrations, increasing revenue for MEMSOF, and increasing the amount 
of funding mandated to the Amoss Fund.

Increase Required Share of Local Reimbursement for Property Valuation 
Expenditures 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Increases the local cost share amount, from 50% to 90%, that 
Baltimore City and county governments are required to pay the State Department of 
Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) for costs associated with real property valuation, 
business personal property valuation, and information technology beginning in fiscal 2026. 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $21.2 million in 
general fund reductions and $21.2 million in special fund appropriations, contingent on the 
enactment of legislation that changes the cost split between the State and the counties from 
50/50 to 90/10.

$21.2 million and special fund revenues and expenditures increase correspondingly in 
fiscal 2026 due to the shift in costs from the State to local governments. Future years reflect 
inflation. 
 
Local Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Local expenditures increase by $21.2 million in 
fiscal 2026 and by $23.0 million in fiscal 2030. Local expenditures are calculated on the 
basis of each jurisdiction’s share of real property accounts and the business personal 
property assessable base for the preceding fiscal year. The increase in local expenditures 
for fiscal 2026 is shown in Exhibit 1. 
 
Program Description:  SDAT conducts the assessment of all property in the State. 
Baltimore City and county governments are required to reimburse SDAT for 50% of the 
costs associated with real property valuation, business personal property valuation, and 
information technology.

Eliminate Funding Requirement for 9-8-8 Trust Fund 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Repeals the one-time funding requirement that the Governor provide 
in fiscal 2025 an appropriation of $12.0 million for the 9-8-8 Trust Fund. The fiscal 2026 
budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a $3.0 million general fund reduction 
in fiscal 2025, contingent on the enactment of legislation eliminating the mandate.

State Effect:  General fund expenditures for the MDH Behavioral Health Administration 
decrease by $3.0 million in fiscal 2025, reflecting the contingent general fund reduction. 
Special fund revenues for the 9-8-8 Trust Fund decrease correspondingly. While, typically, 
special fund expenditures would be expected to decrease as well, special fund expenditures 
are not affected due to the availability of special funds generated by telephone fees. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  Chapters 145 and 146 of 2022 established the 9-8-8 Trust Fund to 
provide reimbursement for costs associated with designating and maintaining 9-8-8 as the 
universal telephone number for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis 
hotline and developing and implementing a statewide initiative for the coordination and 
delivery of the continuum of behavioral health crisis response services. 
 
Recent History:  Chapters 260 and 261 of 2023 established a one-time funding mandate 
of $12.0 million in fiscal 2025 to support the 9-8-8 Trust Fund. Chapters 780 and 781 of 
2024 established a $0.25 fee for specific 9-8-8 accessible services in Maryland beginning 
October 1, 2024. 
 
Chapter 716 of 2024 (the fiscal 2025 budget bill) included $12.0 million in general funds 
for the 9-8-8 Trust Fund to meet the mandate. In July 2024, the Board of Public Works 
authorized a general fund reduction of $9.0 million for the 9-8-8 Trust Fund due to the 
availability of special funds. Accounting for this provision, no funds would remain from 
the fiscal 2025 mandated funding. Beginning in fiscal 2025, 9-8-8 expenditures are 
expected to be supported by special fund revenue from the State 9-8-8 telephone fees.

Program Description:  The State, as an employer, reimburses the UI program  
dollar-for-dollar for benefits paid to eligible claimants in the prior quarter. The State 
maintains a fund for the purpose of making these payments to the UI program and budgets 
14 cents for every $100 of payroll for this purpose. 
 
Recent History:  Section 9 from Chapter 717 authorized a transfer of $60.0 million from 
this program to the general fund. In addition, the fiscal 2025 budget included a decrease of 
$6.0 million in general funds for UI contributions to lower the UI contribution rate on 
State employee payroll from 28 cents to 14 cents. Supplemental Budget No. 1 to the 
fiscal 2026 budget decreased general funds by $7.5 million to lower the UI contribution 
rate on State employee payroll from 28 cents to 14 cents.

State Effect:  General fund revenues increase by $197.4 million in fiscal 2025. 
Special fund expenditures decrease in fiscal 2025 through 2028; however, as the timing of 
the expenditures cannot be reliably estimated, any such reduction is not reflected above. 
Some projects are not proceeding or do not need the provided DPA funding. Also, for some 
other projects, DPA funding is being replaced with funding from other sources. 
 
Local Effect:  No direct impact. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  DPA is established to retain appropriations for 
major, multi-year expenditures in which the magnitude and timing of cash needs are 
uncertain and to meet expenditure requirements that may be affected by changes in 
federal law or fiscal policies or other contingencies. Funds remain available in DPA for 
four years after the close of the fiscal year in which the funds were appropriated. 
 
 
Cybersecurity ($63,478,440):  Funding for cybersecurity purposes has been 
included as an appropriation to DPA each year beginning in fiscal 2021:  
$10.0 million in fiscal 2021; $100.0 million in fiscal 2022; $100.0 million in 
fiscal 2023; and $152.0 million in fiscal 2024. Approximately $149.5 million was 

END OF PAGE 185

START OF PAGE 186
HB 352/ Page 186 
transferred to the general fund by Chapter 717 of 2024 (the Budget Reconciliation 
and Financing Act (BRFA) of 2024). With this transfer, no funds would remain in 
DPA for cybersecurity. 
 
 
State veterans home ($62,887,000):  Approximately $69.6 million was provided for 
this project over fiscal 2023 and 2024. The project has been cancelled because 
necessary federal grants were not awarded. 
 
 
UMMS Comprehensive Cancer and Organ Transplant Center ($25,000,000):  
UMMS received $125.0 million in total State support through fiscal 2023 for the 
Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center and other 
high-acuity ambulatory and inpatient programs located in Baltimore City. This 
included $25.0 million of general funds in DPA which are proposed to be transferred 
to the general fund. The fiscal 2026 capital budget as passed by the 
General Assembly provides general obligation (GO) bond funds to fully replace the 
transferred funds. 
 
 
State Center relocation costs ($20,000,000):  A total of $80.0 million in funding was 
appropriated to DPA for the moving costs of agencies from the Baltimore State 
Center, a 28-acre site featuring several office buildings that has until recently housed 
the Baltimore offices of 12 State agencies. State Center tenants are relocating and 
incurring relocation costs. Following this transfer, approximately $30.0 million will 
remain for this purpose, representing the $30.0 million in fiscal 2024 deficiency 
funds provided in the fiscal 2025 budget bill. 
 
 
DNR critical maintenance ($11,000,000):  The fiscal 2023 budget included 
$100.0 million in general funds in DPA for Facilities Renewal – State Agencies. Of 
this amount, DNR’s allocation was $25.0 million. The funding was intended to help 
reduce DNR’s sizeable backlog of critical maintenance projects and came on the 
heels of the State Park Investment Commission’s December 2021 report, which 
recommended that the State make an immediate investment in critical maintenance 
to eliminate the existing critical maintenance backlog over the next three years. 
Additional funding provided in fiscal 2023 for DNR critical maintenance made it 
less likely that the $25.0 million in DPA would be spent on a timely basis. 
Chapter 39 of 2022 (Great Maryland Outdoors Act) established a Park System 
Critical Maintenance Fund and required a $70.0 million general fund appropriation 
to the fund in fiscal 2024, which must be spent by July 1, 2026. Subsequently, due 
to the likelihood that DNR would not spend the full $70.0 million on critical 
maintenance before the deadline, Chapter 402 of 2024 extended the deadline by 
which DNR must spend the allocated funds by three years (from July1, 2026, to 
July 1, 2029). In the context of the State’s fiscal situation and DNR being replete 

END OF PAGE 186

START OF PAGE 187
HB 352/ Page 187 
with critical maintenance funding, the BRFA of 2024 authorized the transfer of 
$14.0 million of the $25.0 million in DPA to the general fund. This provision 
transfers the remainder of the DNR critical maintenance funding in DPA to the 
general fund. 
 
 
MSU deferred maintenance and site improvements ($10,000,000):  The State funds 
an ongoing deferred maintenance and site improvement project to help address 
MSU’s aging infrastructure and building systems that are inoperable or in poor 
condition. This funding includes $10.0 million of fiscal 2023 general funds in DPA 
which is proposed to be transferred to the general fund. The fiscal 2026 
capital budget as passed by the General Assembly provides $13.4 million of 
GO bond funds for this program, which is $8.4 million more than what was 
programmed for fiscal 2026 in the 2024 session Capital Improvement Program for 
this project to partially replace the proposed transfer. 
 
 
BCCC deferred maintenance ($5,000,000):  The State funds an ongoing deferred 
maintenance and site improvement project to help address BCCC’s aging 
infrastructure and building systems that are inoperable or in poor condition. This 
funding includes $5.0 million of fiscal 2023 general funds in DPA which are 
proposed to be transferred to the general fund. The Administration proposes fully 
replacing the transferred funds with BCCC fund balance reflected as $9.0 million 
of special funds.

particular year are unknown and, thus, are not reflected above. 
 
Local Effect:  Beginning as early as fiscal 2026, local governments may receive less 
funding from ACP-funded programs. Amounts, if any, in any particular year are unknown. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Maryland’s RPS requires that a specified portion 
of retail electricity sold in the State each year come from renewable sources, as defined. 
To demonstrate compliance with RPS requirements, electricity suppliers must submit 
renewable energy credits equal to the percentage specified in statute each year or else pay 
an ACP equivalent to their shortfall. ACPs are paid into SEIF, which is administered by 
MEA. 
 
Generally, ACP revenues may be used only to make loans and grants to support the creation 
of new renewable energy sources in the State that are owned by or directly benefit specified 
communities, households, or businesses. The loans and grants made from solar and 
post-2022 geothermal ACP revenues must be for specified purposes related to solar and 
geothermal energy, including for the Customer-Sited Solar Program from fiscal 2025 
through 2027. Additionally, through June 30, 2027, MEA may use up to 10% of solar 
ACP revenues for administrative expenses. 
 
The Governor’s Fiscal 2026 Budget Books indicated that the fiscal 2024 closing balance 
of the RPS/ACP subaccount of SEIF was $414.2 million.

Program Description/Recent History:  The Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices 
Settlement Fund provides funding for housing counseling, legal assistance related to 
foreclosure and housing, fraud investigations related to housing and mortgage loans,

The fund’s revenues are from judgments against or settlements with bank mortgage 
servicers or other parties in the mortgage servicing industry. As of March 10, 2025, the 
balance of the fund was approximately $14.9 million. 
 
A separate provision expands the allowable uses of the fund to include legal assistance 
related to evictions and legal assistance related to any other legal proceeding, which 
effectuates a contingency in Supplemental Budget No. 1 to use this source as the 
special funds supporting a $1.4 million appropriation for access to counsel.

or evidence-informed health programs. 
 
Recent History:  Prior to accounting for the transfer, GOCPP projects a fiscal 2025 closing 
balance of approximately $4.9 million. Assuming GOCPP’s expenditures occur at 
expected levels, this action will leave approximately $29,000 in the fund’s balance.

$16.4 million in fiscal 2026 only. Special fund expenditures on land acquisition decline by 
$16.4 million over an indeterminate period of years. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The State transfer tax, which is 0.5% of the amount paid for the 
transfer of real property, is used to fund POS, along with several land conservation 
programs and State forest and park operations. DNR administers POS, which acquires and 
improves outdoor recreation and open space areas for public use. POS consists of a State 
and local component. Approximately 50% of the transfer tax funding distributed to POS is 
allocated to State land acquisition and capital development, 30% is allocated to local 
government acquisition and development, and 20% is allocated to State forest and park 
operations. 
 
The Maryland Park Service manages natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources 
in parks across the State and provides related educational services. 
 
Recent History:  The POS State land acquisition balance has been used a number of times 
to help defray State budget shortfalls or otherwise limit the need for the use of State 
general funds. Chapter 39 of 2022 (Great Maryland Outdoors Act) authorized the 
Governor, on or before June 30, 2022, to transfer $43.1 million of the funds for POS State 
land acquisition in the transfer tax special fund to the Park System Capital Improvements 

END OF PAGE 194

START OF PAGE 195
HB 352/ Page 195 
and Acquisition Fund created by Chapter 39, which obviated the need for $43.1 million in 
State general funds for this purpose. 
 
Chapter 717 of 2024 (Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024) authorized the 
Governor to transfer up to $6,678,827 of available special funds from the POS State land 
acquisition fund balance by June 30, 2025, to DNR to replace general funds budgeted for 
personnel expenses in DNR for the Maryland Forest Service and the Maryland Park 
Service. 
 
Anticipated lower amounts of transfer tax revenues in fiscal 2026 coupled with the impact 
of a revenue under attainment in fiscal 2024 once again reduced the available revenues 
distributed through the POS formula to the Maryland Park Service. In addition, the Forest 
or Park Reserve Fund, the other main special fund supporting the Maryland Park Service, 
was reduced to a $0 balance in fiscal 2025 to help fund Maryland Park Service’s operations. 
Therefore, the Forest or Park Reserve Fund balance is not available to backfill for the lower 
transfer tax revenues and support Maryland Park Service operations in fiscal 2026. As of 
September 2024, the POS State land acquisition account had an unencumbered balance of 
$150.0 million, of which approximately $115.0 million was obligated to projects.

State Effect:  No likely impact in fiscal 2025. General fund revenues increase by 
$13.1 million in fiscal 2026. Although authorized to occur in either fiscal 2025 or 2026, 
the budget plan assumes the transfer occurs in fiscal 2026. To the extent that the balance 
in the Maternal and Child Health Population Health Improvement Fund may have been 
used through fiscal 2028, special fund expenditures decrease by up to $13.1 million. 
However, the timing of any potential expenditures in each fiscal year cannot be reliably 
estimated. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2021 
(Chapter 150) established a Maternal and Child Health Population Health Improvement 
Fund to invest in maternal and child health improvements in Medicaid and the Prevention 
and Health Promotion Administration (PHPA) within MDH through calendar 2025. 
Chapters 29 and 30 of 2025 extend the date through which the fund may be used from 
December 31, 2025, to December 31, 2027. The fund is administered by MDH and the 
Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC). Funding is derived from a uniform, 
broad-based assessment built into hospital rates, which must be approved by a majority of 
HSCRC members. For fiscal 2022 through 2025, appropriations from the fund included 
$8.0 million annually under Medicaid to address severe maternal morbidity (funding that 
is eligible for federal matching funds) and $2.0 million annually under PHPA to support 
childhood asthma initiatives and additional maternal morbidity interventions. 
 
Recent History:  The hospital assessment for maternal and child health was approved by 
HSCRC in May 2021 and terminates at the end of calendar 2025. HSCRC approved 
$40.0 million in cumulative funding, and MDH and HSCRC advise that, by the end of 
fiscal 2025, the fund will have a balance of $24.1 million. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed

by the General Assembly includes $10.0 million in special fund expenditures supported 
with this fund across Medicaid and PHPA. Assuming this appropriation is spent and the 
transfer of $13.1 million authorized in this provision occurs in fiscal 2026, the remaining 
balance would be $1.0 million at the end of fiscal 2026.

fund balances of eight health professional licensing boards to the Behavioral Health 
Administration (BHA) within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), so long as the 
fund balance transfers occur by June 30, 2026. Authorizes the transfer of (1) $2,848,653

on the enactment of legislation authorizing the transfers from various health occupation

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. General fund expenditures for provider 
reimbursements in the Community Services program in BHA decrease by $6.9 million in 
fiscal 2026 only due to the available special funds. BHA special fund expenditures increase 
correspondingly in fiscal 2026, although only $4,017,728 is a contingent appropriation. To 
the extent that the eight boards would have used the available fund balance, special fund 
expenditures decrease correspondingly for those boards. However, the timing of any such 
expenditures cannot be reliably estimated. Overall, special fund revenues are not affected, 
merely reallocated within MDH. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  BHA has oversight over publicly funded inpatient and outpatient

Services program; however, the specific uses of the funding are unclear. 
 
The State boards are responsible for the licensing and regulation of individuals practicing 
in each board’s respective field. At the close of fiscal 2024, the special fund balance was 
$4.6 million in the State Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists; $3.7 million in 
the State Board of Physicians Fund; $975,484 in the State Board of Examiners for 
Audiologists, Hearing Aid Dispensers, Speech-Language Pathologists, and Music 
Therapists Fund; $1.2 million in the State Board of Occupational Therapy Practice Fund; 
$2.1 million in the State Board of Examiners for Psychologists Fund; $409,241 in the State 
Board of Dietetic Practice Fund; $589,101 in the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners 
Fund; and $353,544 in the State Board of Acupuncture Fund. 
 
Recent History:  The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2024 authorized 
transfers of $1.6 million from the balance in the State Board of Professional Counselors 
and Therapists Fund, $426,551 from the balance in the State Board of Occupational 
Therapy Practice Fund, and $480,954 from the balance in the State Board of Examiners of

the Judiciary’s major information technology development projects, specified expenditures 
of circuit court offices, eFiling operations and maintenance, MDLandRec, and Electronic 
Land Records Online Imagery operations and maintenance. Revenues for the fund are 
generated through a recordation surcharge on all real estate transactions and other specified 
court surcharges. In December 2024, the Judiciary reported a fiscal 2024 closing balance 
in the fund, excluding encumbrances, of $73.9 million. Accounting for this transfer, the 
projected fiscal 2026 closing fund balance is $31.0 million. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 719 of 2021, Chapter 522 of 2022, and Chapter 762 of 2023

Authorize Transfer from Revenue Stabilization Account to Annuity Bond Fund if 
Necessary for Debt Service Costs 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Authorizes the Governor to transfer sufficient funds by budget 
amendment, if necessary, by June 30, 2026, from the Revenue Stabilization Account 
(Rainy Day Fund) to the Annuity Bond Fund (ABF) to ensure that the State Treasurer is 
able to pay debt service to the State’s bondholders. 
 
Agency:  State Reserve Fund; Public Debt 
 
Type of Action:  Fund balance transfer 
 
State Effect:  The amount of any transfer from the Rainy Day Fund to ABF and 
special fund expenditures for debt service are indeterminate and depend upon the results 
of the June 2025 general obligation (GO) bond sale. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  State property taxes and other revenue sources 
are deposited into ABF to support GO bond debt service costs. State property tax rates are 
insufficient to fund all debt service costs, so the costs are also supported by general fund 
appropriations. The fiscal 2025 bond sale is in June 2025. Financial markets are 
exceptionally volatile; it is unclear what the interest rates will be when the bonds are issued. 
To provide sufficient funds for potential debt service costs should interest rates increase 
more than anticipated, the State Treasurer requested that monies from the Rainy Day Fund 
be made available for debt service costs should costs exceed estimates. The provision 
authorizes this transfer.

Authorize Transfer from Resilient Maryland Revolving Loan Fund to Blueprint for 
Maryland’s Future Fund 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Authorizes the Governor to transfer $9.0 million from the Resilient 
Maryland Revolving Loan Fund (RMRLF) to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund 
(BMFF), so long as the transfer occurs by June 30, 2025.

State Effect:  Special fund revenues are unaffected due to the transfer, which repurposes 
$9.0 million in RMRLF balance for another special fund (BMFF) in fiscal 2025. Current 
projections indicate general funds will be needed to support Blueprint costs beginning in 
fiscal 2027. Therefore, it is assumed that the $9.0 million in BMFF revenue in fiscal 2025 
will result in a reduction of $9.0 million in general fund expenditures in fiscal 2027 and a 
corresponding increase in BMFF expenditures in fiscal 2027. To the extent that the 
RMRLF fund balance may have been used in the future, special fund expenditures decrease 
by up to $9.0 million. However, the timing of any potential expenditures cannot be reliably 
estimated. 
 
Local Effect:  There is a corresponding reduction in RMRLF fund balance available for 
local resilience projects to address hazard mitigation. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 644 of 2021 established RMRLF in 
response to the passage of the federal Safeguarding Tomorrow Through Ongoing Risk 
Mitigation (STORM) Act that went into effect January 1, 2021. The STORM Act 
authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide capitalization 
grants to states that established revolving loan funds for hazard mitigation assistance that 
reduce risks from disasters and other natural hazards. Chapters 244 and 245 of 2022 altered 
RMRLF so that the fund may provide low- or no-interest loans to local governments and 
nonprofit organizations for resilience projects. 
 
The fiscal 2023 budget provided $25.0 million in pay-as-you-go general funds into 
RMRLF to support the required 10% State match for federal STORM Act funds and for 
State funded projects. MDEM received notice in September 2023 from FEMA of a 
total award of $6.5 million. Delays in the federal allocation of awards caused 

END OF PAGE 204

START OF PAGE 205
HB 352/ Page 205 
corresponding delays in RMRLF expenditures, resulting in a fund balance. The closing 
balance at the end of fiscal 2024 was $25.8 million. A budget amendment for fiscal 2025 
appropriated $11.0 million from the fund for two projects. Accounting for the budget 
amendment, the balance should be $15.0 million at the close of fiscal 2025. 
 
The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly allocates $246,064 in RMRLF 
special funds and $130,977 in federal matching funds under MDEM.

Prohibit Interagency Rates Committee from Increasing Provider Rates 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Prohibit, for fiscal 2026 only, the Interagency Rates Committee 
(IRC) from increasing the payment rates for providers whose rates are set by IRC over the 
rates in effect on January 1, 2025. 
 
Agency:  Department of Human Services (DHS); Department of Juvenile Services (DJS); 
Maryland Department of Health (MDH) 
 
Type of Action:  Cost control 
 
State Effect:  The fiscal 2026 budget as introduced included funding to support a 2% rate 
increase for providers with rates set by IRC. However, as IRC is neither required by, nor 
limited under, current law with regard to provision of rate increases, the provision prohibits 
implementation of rate increases for fiscal 2026. As the actual amount that would have 
been provided is not known, general fund and federal fund expenditures are reduced by an 
indeterminate amount. For illustrative purposes only, if a 2% provider rate increase were 
provided, expenditures would have increased by more than $1.2 million in total funds 
($1.1 million in general funds and $0.1 million in federal funds) in the DHS Foster Care 
Maintenance Payments; expenditures in DJS would have also increased. Savings are also 
realized beginning in fiscal 2027 due to the lower base for future provider rate increases. 
 
Despite the fiscal 2026 budget including funds for a 2% provider rate increase, no reduction 
in funding is included in the budget contingent on this provision as the foster care budget 
appears inadequate to cover projected costs. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  IRC establishes rates for residential and 
nonresidential child care programs licensed or approved by the Maryland State Department 
of Education (MSDE), MDH, DHS, and DJS. IRC includes representatives from the 
Department of Budget and Management, MDH, DHS, DJS, MSDE, and the Governor’s 
Office for Children. 
 
In October 2024, a revised rate structure was implemented for Residential Child Care 
(group home) providers with separate rates for direct and clinical care, which is based on 
classes of service provision. Material posted on the IRC website appeared to plan for a 3% 
rate increase for these providers in fiscal 2026, despite a significant overall increase in rates 
with implementation of rate reform (over 19%). Rates for other providers are based on the 
budgets of providers as compared to similar providers and are also impacted by when 
during the year applications for rates are submitted. For example, according to the 
information on the IRC website, applications submitted by February 15, 2025, were

Specify Procedures for Renewing Horse Establishment Licenses 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require the Maryland Horse Industry Board (MHIB) to send horse 
establishment license renewal notices/forms at least one month before license expiration 
and allow (1) a 60-day grace period after expiration, when a license can be renewed 
retroactively with payment of the renewal fee and any late fee and (2) after the grace period, 
license reinstatement, with payment of the renewal fee and a reinstatement fee. 
 
Agency:  Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) 
 
Type of Action:  Other 
 
State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Special fund revenues for MHIB increase relatively 
minimally (by at least $10,000 in fiscal 2026, $7,500 in fiscal 2027, and $5,000 annually 
thereafter) due to collection of late fees and reinstatement fees. Expenditures are not 
affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MHIB, which is housed at MDA, regulates and promotes the 
State’s horse industry. The board promotes horse exhibitions, horse shows, rodeos, 
pony clubs, etc. held in the State. Among other duties, MHIB carries out licensing, 
inspection, and enforcement related to the equine industry.

Increase Percentage of Open Purses that May Be Paid to Maryland Thoroughbred 
Horsemen’s Association 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Increases the maximum percentage of open thoroughbred racing 
purses, from 2% to 3%, that may be deducted from the purses and paid to the Maryland 
Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association. 
 
Agency:  Maryland Department of Labor 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  None. The bill does not affect State revenues or expenditures but rather 
allows the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association to deduct a larger percentage 
of open purses. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  The Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s 
Association may deduct up to 2% from open purses to be paid to the association. 
Approximately 85% of the open purse money is distributed to the overnight races of the 
current year and approximately 15%, but not more than 17%, to the stakes races of the 
current year. 
 
In 2023, the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association was paid approximately 
$1.3 million from open purse money. If the percentage the association is allowed to keep 
were increased to 3%, the association could realize a revenue increase of approximately 
$641,000 annually.

Authority (MTROA), effective June 30, 2025. Make the Maryland Stadium Authority 
(MSA) the successor entity for the planning, design, construction, and ownership of a 
racing and community development project and the Maryland Economic Development 
Corporation (MEDCO) the successor entity for the operation of a racing and community 
development project. Transfer all rights, responsibilities, personal property, etc. of 
MTROA, including those related to the Maryland Jockey Club (MJC), to MEDCO. 
 
Establish that a nonprofit operator of a racing and community development project (1) may 
not be construed to be an agency or instrumentality of the State, or a unit of the executive 
branch, for any purpose; (2) may be replaced with another business entity with the 
concurrent approval of MSA and MEDCO; and (3) must reimburse MSA for the cost of a 
full-time auditor responsible for overseeing the financial transactions and records related 
to racing and community development project costs and ongoing operations.

State Effect:  The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes a 
special fund reduction of $3,463,204 for administration and eliminates six regular positions 
(three of which are vacant) at MTROA, contingent on the enactment of these provisions 
abolishing MTROA before fiscal 2026. Accordingly, all funding and positions at MTROA 
are eliminated for fiscal 2026. Although special fund savings likely also occur in 
fiscal 2027 through 2029 from abolishing those positions, that impact is not reflected 
above.  
 
Chapter 590 of 2020, as amended by Chapter 410 of 2024, authorized MSA, subject to the 
approval of the Board of Public Works (BPW), to issue up to $400.0 million in bonds to 
finance planning, design, and construction and related expenses for construction 
management, professional fees, and contingencies in connection with racing facilities. It 
is, therefore, assumed that MSA can handle the requirements of the bill with existing 
budgeted resources. To the extent that MSA requires additional funding or positions to

carry out responsibilities associated with conducting a racing and community development 
project, the agency can request additional resources through the annual budget process. 
 
The bill does not transfer any funding or positions to MEDCO. To the extent that MEDCO 
requires additional funding or positions to carry out responsibilities associated with 
overseeing the operation of a racing and community development project, the agency can 
request additional resources through the annual budget process. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  Chapter 111 of 2023 established MTROA to 
manage and oversee day-to-day thoroughbred horse racing operations, live racing days, 
and assets in the State and, in coordination with MEDCO, acquire property or contractual 
interests, as specified. Under such circumstances, the Maryland Racing Commission may 
issue a license and live racing days to MTROA. Under Chapter 410 of 2024, MTROA 
terminates on June 30, 2029. Chapter 410 also provided for the transfer of ownership and 
operation of thoroughbred racing facilities in the State to MTROA. 
 
BPW approved the transfer of Pimlico Race Course to MTROA in May 2024. In addition, 
MJC was created in September 2024 as the nonprofit entity required to coordinate racing 
operations. All operational contracts and employee agreements for the prior Maryland 
Jockey Club were reviewed and assigned to the new MJC. The new MJC assumed  
day-to-day control of all horse racing operations in Maryland on January 1, 2025.

Reduce Funding Cap per Participant under Low Intensity Support Services Program 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Reduces the cap that the Developmental Disabilities Administration 
(DDA) within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) is authorized to establish under 
the Low Intensity Support Services (LISS) program from a cap of no less than $2,000 to a 
cap of no less than $1,000 for services per qualifying individual per fiscal year beginning 
in fiscal 2026. 
 
Agency:  MDH 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  General fund expenditures for DDA are not directly affected, given the 
expectation that DDA utilizes all budgeted funds under the LISS program but serves a 
larger number of individuals than would otherwise have occurred with the same level of 
funds due to the reduced cap of $1,000 per qualifying individual per fiscal year. The 
fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly includes $2.0 million in 
general funds for the LISS program. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  DDA funds direct services to intellectually and developmentally 
disabled individuals through a coordinated community-based service delivery system. 
LISS provides temporary financial support for individuals on the DDA Community 
Services Waiting List and/or individuals who do not receive support through the 
three Medicaid home- and community-based services waivers administered by DDA. 
Some of the eligible services and items include adaptive items, assistive technology, 
attendant care/personal care, recreational services and items, therapeutic summer 
programs, and several other supports. Individuals must submit an application that includes 
an invoice or receipts for goods and services and must apply through a random selection

the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to serve as the foundation for advancing 
primary care in the State under the Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and 
Development (AHEAD) model. Derive funding support for the new special fund from 
hospital payments administered on a one-time basis, through a uniform and broad-based 
assessment via the Medicare savings component for calendar 2023, by the Health Services 
Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) and any other source accepted for the fund. The

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. MDH indicates that a total of $30.0 million in 
hospital payments, generated as a result of performance incentives for calendar 2023 
Medicare savings under the Total Cost of Care Model, will be transferred from HSCRC to 
MDH to capitalize the MDPCP Fund. Supplemental Budget No. 1 added $16.0 million in 
special funds that are contingent on the enactment of legislation allowing the use of the 
MDPCP Fund for Medicaid provider reimbursements. The remaining $14.0 million to be 
transferred is assumed to be spent in fiscal 2027. Thus, MDH special fund revenues and 
expenditures increase accordingly in fiscal 2026 and 2027. Federal matching revenues and 
expenditures of at least 50% for Medicaid expenses also increase accordingly. 
Expenditures and revenues are not affected beginning in fiscal 2028 as MDH did not 
indicate plans for another transfer from HSCRC or any other dedicated funding source for 
the new special fund. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The AHEAD Model, effective January 1, 2026, is a partnership 
between the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Maryland to continue 
the State’s all-payer hospital rate setting system and control health care costs, among other 
initiatives. A component of the AHEAD Model is a new Advanced Primary Care Program

under Medicaid that will begin implementation on July 1, 2025, and will be supported by 
the new MDPCP Fund established in these provisions. This program will operate similarly 
to the existing Maryland Primary Care Program, which is a component of the State’s 
current Total Cost of Care Model that aims to reduce Medicare costs, among other efforts. 
Through the program, MDH will provide care management fees of $2 per member 
per month assigned to eligible primary care practices and administer a quality incentive 
program for the calendar 2026 performance year.

Increase Cap on Maryland Environmental Service Contingency Funds 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Increases the cap on two of the three Maryland Environmental 
Service (MES) project contingency funds to increase the total amounts of funding that can 
be retained in these funds for current and future costs for projects located at  
State-owned facilities. Raises the Eastern Correctional Institution Turbine Project 
Contingency Fund cap from $1.5 million to $5.0 million and raises the Reimbursable 
Project Contingency Fund cap from $1.0 million to $3.0 million. 
 
Agency:  MES 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  No immediate impact on State revenues or expenditures. Raising the caps 
on both contingency funds allows MES to continue to fulfill its contractual obligations and 
permits compliance as current and future estimated maintenance and repair costs exceed 
current contingency fund caps. However, raising the caps on both contingency funds does 
not require the funds to be funded at that level. Funding levels will be gradually increased 
over time based on estimated future funding needs. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MES is an independent instrumentality of the State that is 
nonbudgeted and provides a variety of environmental-related services on a reimbursable 
basis to other State agencies and at State-owned facilities, including the operation and 
maintenance of all State-owned water and wastewater treatment facilities. Funds retained 
in the Reimbursable Project Contingency Fund are used to support major facility 
maintenance and emergency repairs to State-owned facilities outside of Department of 
Natural Resources facilities (which have a separate contingency fund), and not including 
the Eastern Correctional Institution Turbine Project (which is supported through its own 
contingency fund).

Eliminate Requirement for Operating Expense Growth in Transportation Trust 
Fund Forecast 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Eliminates the requirement that operating expenses in the 
Transportation Trust Fund Forecast, for years beyond the budget year, be increased by the 
five-year average annual increase in actual operating expenses ending with the most 
recently completed fiscal year (excluding availability payments made to public-private 
partnership concessionaires) in developing departmental operating expense estimates, 
provided that the rate for these years cannot vary by more than 0.5 percentage points from 
the rate used in the prior forecast. 
 
Agency:  Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  The provision does not directly affect revenues or expenditures for MDOT 
since it affects the planning years of the forecast only; however, it may decrease the amount 
of operating spending programmed in the financial forecast for the planning years and 
increase the amount programmed in the planning years for capital projects. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MDOT must submit a six-year supporting financial forecast to the 
Consolidated Transportation Program showing, among other things, a schedule of 
operating expenses for each specific modal administration. MDOT must provide for debt 
service and operating expenses from available revenues first, with remaining funding being 
available to support the capital program. Increased spending for operating decreases the 
amount available for capital. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 10 of 2018 established the requirement that MDOT increase 
operating expenses for the planning years of the financial forecast by the average annual 
increase in actual operating expenses for the five-year period ending with the most recently 
completed fiscal year. The provision prevents MDOT from using unrealistically 
low operating expense assumptions in order to maximize the levels of capital spending it 
was projecting in the planning years of the forecast.

Increase Amount of Consolidated Transportation Bonds that May Be Issued  
 
Provision in the Bill:  Increases the debt outstanding limit on Consolidated Transportation 
Bonds (CTBs) from $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion. 
 
Agency:  Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  Increasing the debt outstanding limit on CTBs may increase capital spending 
in the capital budget, which results in an increase in Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) 
expenditures in the operating budget due to increased debt service payments. The impact 
is indeterminate due to uncertainty about when the increased capacity to issue debt would 
be utilized; nevertheless, TTF expenditures could increase significantly. For illustrative 
purposes only, if an additional $500.0 million in CTBs were issued in fiscal 2026, TTF 
expenditures from debt service would increase by an estimated $164.0 million in total 
between fiscal 2026 and 2030. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MDOT issues 15-year CTBs to help fund its capital program. 
MDOT’s current debt outstanding limit is set in statute at $4.5 billion. Typically, when 
MDOT is provided significant additional revenue, the debt outstanding cap is increased in 
recognition of MDOT’s ability to issue more debt. This additional bonding must be used 
to support capital spending. Any additional debt issued by MDOT must be within the 
State’s Capital Debt Affordability limits. 
 
Recent History:  The limit on CTBs outstanding was last increased by Chapter 429 of 
2013.

Expand Pledge of Future Federal Aid to Include Major Rehabilitation of Existing 
Light Rail System 
 
Provision in the Bill:  Expands the types of projects that the Maryland Department of 
Transportation (MDOT) may fund using proceeds from bonds backed by future federal aid 
(typically known as Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle (GARVEE) bonds) to include the 
major rehabilitation of the existing light rail system, including replacement light rail 
vehicles and related station and maintenance facility improvements. 
 
Agency:  MDOT 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  The provision does not directly affect total revenues or expenditures for 
MDOT because it authorizes, but does not require, MDOT to use GARVEE bonds for an 
additional project and does not change the $1.0 billion debt outstanding limit on the total 
issuance of these bonds. The provision would grant MDOT additional flexibility to fund 
its capital program beginning as early as fiscal 2027 because the Consolidated 
Transportation Program for fiscal 2025 through 2030 assumes passage of legislation to 
authorize the use of GARVEE bonds to modernize the State’s light rail transit vehicle fleet. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  The Transportation Article authorizes MDOT to issue GARVEE 
bonds to support certain projects in the capital program. The bonds are backed by and 
repaid from future federal aid. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 455 of 2023 expanded the authority of MDOT to issue GARVEE 
bonds for additional transportation projects as long as the aggregate outstanding and unpaid 
principal amount of debt issued does not exceed $1.0 billion as of June 30 of any year. 
However, the proceeds of those bonds may only be used for six specified projects.

State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025 or 2026. TTF expenditures decrease by an 
anticipated $28.0 million annually from fiscal 2027 through 2031 due to deferring 
procuring ZEBs to fiscal 2032 and the lower costs associated with procuring new buses. 
Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description:  MTA operates a comprehensive multimodal transit system 
throughout the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area, including more than 50 local bus 
lines in the Baltimore metropolitan area served by a fleet of more than 800 buses. Core bus 
ridership in fiscal 2024 totaled more than 47.9 million. Bus procurement occurs annually 
to replace those that have been in service for 12 or more years to maintain the average age 
of the bus fleet. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 693 of 2021 prohibited MTA, beginning in fiscal 2023, from 
procuring buses for the transit fleet that are not ZEBs. However, it allows the agency to 
purchase alternative-fuel buses if the agency determines that no ZEBs meet performance 
requirements needed for a particular use. Chapter 717 of 2024 (Budget Reconciliation and 
Financing Act of 2024) delayed from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2027 the year by which MTA is 
prohibited from procuring buses for the transit fleet that are not ZEBs and also authorized 
MTA to procure additional alternative-fuel buses, including hybrid buses, if sufficient 
ZEBs or associated equipment to meet the requirement are not commercially available.

Alter Income Tax Apportionment of Pass-through Entity Income  
 
Provision in the Bill:  Modifies, for tax year 2026 and beyond, the income tax 
apportionment of pass-through entity (PTE) income with respect to resident members such 
that each resident member’s distributive or pro rata share of the PTE’s income is fully 
apportioned to Maryland. 
 
Agency:  Comptroller 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  The change is expected to be revenue neutral; thus, there is no anticipated 
effect on State revenues. The Comptroller’s Office may incur one-time general fund costs 
in fiscal 2026 only for related programming changes; however, a precise estimate is not 
available at this time. 
 
Local Effect:  The change is expected to be revenue neutral; thus, there is no anticipated 
effect on local revenues. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  In response to federal law that limits the 
allowable state and local tax deduction for individuals in tax years 2018 through 2025, 
Maryland, like a number of other states, enacted legislation authorizing PTEs to elect to be 
taxed at the entity level for State income tax purposes. A member of an electing PTE may 
claim a credit for the amount of Maryland income tax paid by the PTE that is attributable 
to the member’s share of the PTE’s taxable income. “PTE’s taxable income” is defined as 
the portion of a PTE’s income under the federal Internal Revenue Code, calculated without 
regard to any deduction for taxes based on net income that are imposed by any state or 
political subdivision of a state, that is derived from or reasonably attributable to the trade 
or business of the PTE in Maryland. A resident member of a multistate PTE may claim a 
credit against the State income tax for income tax paid to another state, including the 
member’s pro rata share of income tax paid by the PTE to another state.

Baltimore City Direct Grant projects within the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) 
allocated as part of the Program Open Space (POS) State allocation that either have been 
(1) abandoned or (2) completed with funding remaining. Reduces, more specifically, 
$1,125,000 for the Herring Run Park project, $300,000 for the Druid Hill Trail Head 
project, $100,000 for the Saint Charles Park project, $21,400 for the Bond Street Park

State Effect:  Special fund revenues increase by $1,596,400 in fiscal 2025 due to the

Local Effect:  No overall effect, as the same level of funding is provided to Baltimore City 
for five new projects through Section 21 of the fiscal 2026 operating budget bill as passed 
by the General Assembly. 
 
Program Description:  DNR administers POS, which acquires and improves outdoor 
recreation and open space areas for public use. POS consists of a State and local 
component. Approximately 50% of the transfer tax funding distributed to POS is allocated 
to State land acquisition and capital development, 30% is allocated to local government 
acquisition and development, and 20% is allocated to State forest and park operations. Of 
the 50% of POS funding allocated to State land acquisition and capital development, 
$10.0 million of that funding, each fiscal year, must be used to make grants to 
Baltimore City for projects which meet park purposes. This funding is in addition to 
funding the city receives from the 30% of POS funding allocated to local government 
acquisition and development. 
 
Recent History:  The $1,596,400 in reduced funding for the five projects is tied to the 
following allocations and appropriations: 
 
 
$1,125,000 for the Herring Run Park project, with $400,000 allocated in fiscal 2018 
per a statutory requirement (Chapter 10 of 2016 as amended by Chapter 407 of 
2017) and $725,000 allocated in fiscal 2019, comprising $100,000 per a statutory

requirement (Chapter 407) and $625,000 in the fiscal 2019 operating budget 
(Chapter 570 of 2018); 
 
$300,000 allocated to the Druid Hill Trail Head project in fiscal 2018 per a statutory 
requirement (Chapter 10); 
 
$100,000 appropriated to the Saint Charles Park project in the fiscal 2019 operating 
budget (Chapter 570); 
 
$21,400 remaining of the $50,000 appropriated to the Bond Street Park project in 
the fiscal 2020 operating budget (Chapter 565 of 2019); and 
 
$50,000 appropriated to the Warwick Park project in the fiscal 2020 operating 
budget (Chapter 565). 
 
Chapter 39 of 2022 (Great Maryland Outdoors Act) increased from $6.0 million each 
fiscal year to $10.0 million each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal 2024, the amount of POS 
State funding that is used to make grants to Baltimore City for projects which meet park 
purposes.

Baltimore County for a different library project through Section 21 of the fiscal 2026 
operating budget bill as passed by the General Assembly. 
 
Program Description:  The DGS Capital Grants and Loans Office administers capital 
PAYGO grants appropriated to the agency and general obligation bond funded grants as 
delegated to DGS by the Board of Public Works (BPW). Under § 7-305 of the State Finance 
and Procurement— Article, the authority to spend a capital appropriation for a project 
terminates two years after the effective date of the appropriation if there has been no 
evidence of a matching fund, if required, or no part of the project is under contract and 
BPW has not encumbered money for any part of the project. 
 
Recent History:  The fiscal 2024 budget included a $12.0 million general fund capital 
PAYGO grant to the County Executive and County Council of Baltimore County for 
infrastructure improvements to the Lansdowne Library, which the county is unable to use 
for its intended purpose.

Program Description:  Artscape is billed as America’s largest free outdoor arts festival 
and is organized by the Baltimore Office of Promotion & The Arts. The festival originated 
in 1982 as a way to draw community support and stimulate economic development and 
investment near the then newly developed Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. 
 
Recent History:  The fiscal 2024 budget added $1.5 million in general funds to the 
appropriation for the BPW – Miscellaneous Grants to Local Governments program to 
provide funding to the Baltimore City Mayor’s Office of Art and Culture for the 
2023 Artscape Festival.

Establish Requirements to Certify Specified Federal Fund Revenue Loss and Report 
Budgetary Impact 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require that, if congressional action or other federal changes result 
in a reduction of at least $1.0 billion in the State’s estimated federal fund revenues 
compared to the federal funding budgeted in fiscal 2026, within 30 days of the 
determination or estimate of the federal fund revenue loss, the Secretary of Budget and 
Management must certify whether the reduction is at least $1.0 billion. Require the 
Department of Budget and Management (DBM), if a reduction of at least $1.0 billion in 
federal fund revenue is certified, within 90 days of the certification, to submit a report to 
the Legislative Policy Committee with (1) a description of the impact of the reduced 
federal fund revenues by program and (2) proposed actions, including reductions if 
appropriate. 
 
Agency:  DBM 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  DBM can fulfill reporting requirements under these provisions with existing 
resources. Revenues are not directly affected. 
 
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Program Description/Recent History:  In the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly, federal funding accounts for $19.5 billion, or approximately 29% of 
the total budget. Federal grants are classified as block grants or categorical grants, and in 
many instances, federal funds must be matched by State funds in a prescribed ratio. 
Medicaid and highway construction are two activities that particularly rely on federal 
funds. Other programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, provide benefits that 
are entirely supported with federal funds. Maryland currently receives substantial 
federal fund participation under Medicaid through a matching rate of 50% for most costs 
to implement the program, with some groups receiving enhanced matching rates of 65% 
and 90%. 
 
The federal Administration and a budget resolution passed by the U.S. Congress in 
March 2025 have called for or proposed substantial reductions in federal spending, 
including in areas of grants and programs receiving federal reimbursement. The largest 
potential impacts on the State budget include potential changes to the Medicaid 
reimbursement model, though other proposals could lead to significant lost federal revenue 
and/or increase State costs both due to changes in federal reimbursement and to the extent 
the State proposes to backfill in full or part lost federal revenue.

Require Independent Audit of Prince George’s County Board of Education  
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Require the Prince George’s County Board of Education to use a 
competitive bidding process to procure, by August 1, 2025, an independent certified public 
accounting firm to conduct a performance (and/or financial) audit of all board revenues 
and expenditures from fiscal 2024 onward. Establish that a firm that provides services to 
the board may not bid on the procurement. Require, on award of the contract and before 
commencement of the audit, the firm to consult with the Joint Audit and Evaluation 
Committee (JAEC) and the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) Office of Legislative 
Audits (OLA) in the development of the audit’s scope and objectives. Require the audit 
report to be submitted to JAEC, OLA, and the General Assembly by January 1, 2026. 
 
Agency:  DLS, OLA 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  OLA can consult on the design and scope of the audit with existing resources. 
 
Local Effect:  Prince George’s County Board of Education expenditures increase by an 
indeterminate, but potentially significant, amount to procure an independent certified 
public accounting firm to conduct the audit as specified. Exact costs depend on the results 
of the competitive bidding process; however, Prince George’s County Public Schools 
(PGCPS) advises that procuring an audit of this size and scope likely costs at least 
$200,000. 
 
Program Description:  Generally, local boards of education implement the public 
education laws, regulations, and policies of the State Board of Education. Local boards of 
education and the local superintendents appointed by the local boards control educational 
matters and policymaking within the school districts and oversee the day-to-day operation 
of public schools. 
 
Recent History:  Chapter 792 of 2023 established the Office of Integrity and Compliance 
(OIC) within PGCPS. OIC is required to (1) assist the county council and the local school 
system by providing independent evaluation and recommendations regarding opportunities 
to preserve the local school system’s reputation and improve the effectiveness, 
productivity, or efficiency of school system programs, policies, practices, and operations; 
(2) ensure public accountability by preventing, investigating, and reporting instances of 
fraud, waste, and abuse of school system property or funds; (3) examine, evaluate, and 
report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of internal controls and their related 
accounting, financial, technology, and operational policies; and (4) report noncompliance 
with and propose ways to improve employee compliance with applicable law, policy, and 
ethical standards of conduct. Chapter 776 of 2024 specifies that OIC is an independent

Delegate Authority to Conduct Nursing Home Surveys and Complaint Investigations 
in Montgomery County 
 
Provisions in the Bill:  Authorize Montgomery County to request, and accordingly require 
the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to delegate, authority for the county to conduct 
nursing home surveys and complaint investigations if MDH failed to comply with specified 
survey requirements in fiscal 2023 and 2024. Require, within 90 days of a request, MDH 
to execute a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Montgomery County that 
(1) delegates to the county the requirement to conduct surveys and complaint 
investigations, as specified; (2) commits the county to paying 50% of the costs for up to 
60 months; and (3) is modeled after a specified MOU that MDH executed with the county 
on July 1, 2019. Require MDH to calculate the cost share for the county in a manner that 
may not exceed 50% of the costs for conducting surveys and complaint investigations in 
fiscal 2020, adjusted for inflation, as specified. Require MDH to ensure that the 
general fund savings of shifting 50% of the State costs to the county accrues to MDH for 
the immediately following fiscal year to comply with specified nursing home oversight 
requirements on a statewide basis. 
 
Agency:  MDH 
 
Type of Action:  Miscellaneous 
 
State Effect:  No impact in fiscal 2025. Assuming that Montgomery County requests and 
is granted delegated authority to conduct surveys and complaint investigations in 
fiscal 2026, MDH general fund expenditures increase by an indeterminate but significant 
amount annually in fiscal 2026 through 2030. Expenditures reflect, at a minimum, payment 
of 50% of the costs for conducting surveys and complaint investigations in 
Montgomery County. MDH advises that the total cost to conduct all surveys and 
investigations for the 34 nursing homes in the county is approximately $1.0 million 
annually. Additionally, MDH advises that the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) 
would require additional State personnel to manage the MOU and maintain federal 
accountability. Delegating authority to Montgomery County allows OHCQ to redirect 
State personnel to conducting inspections and surveys in other jurisdictions and may allow 
filling of fewer vacant positions going forward, which may offset some State costs. 
Revenues are not affected. 
 
Local Effect:  To the extent Montgomery County is granted delegated authority to conduct 
surveys and complaint investigations, expenditures increase by an indeterminate but 
potentially significant amount beginning as early as fiscal 2026 to pay 50% of the costs for 
up to 60 months, as specified. Montgomery County estimates that additional staff are 
required to conduct nursing home surveys and complaint investigations in the county. 

END OF PAGE 230

START OF PAGE 231
HB 352/ Page 231 
Program Description:  To ensure compliance with specified federal and/or State 
requirements, OHCQ generally makes an unannounced site visit and conducts a full survey 
of each licensed nursing home at least once per year. After a nursing home complaint 
alleging actual harm, OHCQ must initiate an investigation within 10 business days. If 
MDH receives a complaint alleging immediate jeopardy to a resident, it must make every 
effort to investigate the complaint within 24 hours, and no later than 48 hours, after 
receiving the complaint. 
 
Recent History:  A previous MOU between MDH and the Montgomery County 
Department of Health and Human Services authorized Montgomery County to survey new 
and existing nursing home facilities in Montgomery County, conduct follow-up visits and 
complaint investigations, and participate in the informal dispute resolution process. MDH 
did not reinstate the previous MOU.

1 Although counties must pay $97,744,521 each year, the amount of the contingent reductions in the budget 
bill total to a negligibly lower amount of $97,744,519. 
 
Notes: The total impact reflects amounts no longer paid by the State; accordingly, equivalent costs are 
incurred by local jurisdictions in fiscal 2026 due to the four selected provisions. However, not shown above, 
revenues to local governments increase from additional local income tax revenues beginning in fiscal 2026 
due to altering deductions and authorizing counties to increase the maximum income tax rate a county may 
impose on Maryland taxable income from 3.2% to 3.3%. Numbers may not sum to total due to rounding.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL: 
Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2025 
 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB0352 
 
PREPARED BY: 
 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
          WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
    X    WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
PART B.  ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
The Department of Budget and Management has reviewed the provisions of HB 352, The 
Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2025, and believes that some provisions of the 
legislation will result in an impact on small businesses.  The department would highlight 
the following provisions: 
 
● 
Various fee and penalty provisions applied to programs administered by the 
Departments of Agriculture and Environment could increase costs to small 
businesses. 
● 
Small businesses that "pass through" business income to their personal income tax 
will be impacted by the changes to the personal income tax.  There are no specific 
changes related to business income, though. Thus, any impact for a business 
taxpayer is the same as any other taxpayer (individual or business) with similar 
income and living circumstances. 
● 
Small businesses that pay corporate income tax will see a reduction in their tax bills 
compared to the current law beginning in fiscal year 2028.  The reduction will 
increase in fiscal year 2029.

● 
Reducing the mandate for Maryland Watermen’s Microloan program one year 
earlier than under current law will result in fewer loans being made in fiscal 2026 
and could result in the liquidation of the program sooner than under current law. 
● 
The freeze in enrollment to the Enterprise Zone credit means that all businesses 
would no longer be able to apply and be awarded tax credits for projects in 
fiscal year 2026 and future fiscal years.
