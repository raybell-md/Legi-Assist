on the ballot. The local board must count only the votes cast by the individual in a

Provisional Voting 
 
An individual is eligible to cast a provisional ballot if the individual declares in a written 
affirmation submitted with the provisional ballot that the individual is a registered voter in 
the State, is eligible to vote in that election, and either the individual’s name does not appear 
on the precinct register, an election official asserts that the individual is not eligible to vote, 
or the individual does not have the necessary identification.

HB 839/ Page 2 
An individual is qualified to vote the provisional ballot cast if the local board of elections 
determines that (1) the individual is registered in the State; (2) if the provisional ballot was 
cast because the voter failed to provide required identification, the individual who cast the 
provisional ballot has met the identification requirements established by the State Board of 
Elections; and (3) if the provisional ballot was cast during a period covered by a court order 
or other order extending the time for closing the polls, the order has not been invalidated 
by a subsequent court order.  
 
The local board must count (1) the entire provisional ballot if the address on the provisional 
ballot application is within the precinct where the provisional ballot was cast or (2) only 
the votes cast by the voter for each candidate or question applicable to the precinct in which 
the voter resides, as determined by the address on the provisional ballot application of the 
voter.  
 
The local board must reject a provisional ballot if (1) the local board determines that the 
individual who cast the provisional ballot is not qualified to vote that provisional ballot; 
(2) the individual failed to sign the oath on the provisional ballot application; or (3) the 
local board determines that a provisional ballot is intentionally marked with an identifying 
mark that is clearly evident and placed on the ballot for the purpose of identifying the ballot.

Appendix – Local Boards of Education Membership 
 
 
The composition of the local boards of education varies with members serving three- to 
four-year terms. Twenty counties have elected school boards and four counties have 
combined appointed and elected school boards. Twenty-two boards have student members; 
however, only eight boards allow student members to vote, which generally excludes 
authority to vote on matters relating to collective bargaining and personnel. Three counties 
with voting student members also preclude student members from voting on matters 
relating to operating and capital budgets. Exhibit 1 shows the selection methods, terms of 
office, and membership of the twenty-four local school boards.
