FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Third Reader - Revised 
House Bill 738 
(Delegate Kaiser, et al.) 
Health and Government Operations 
Budget and Taxation 
 
Department of Information Technology - Major Information Technology 
Development Projects - Oversight 
 
 
This bill makes various changes to the statutory framework governing the funding, 
management, and oversight of major information technology (IT) development projects for 
State agencies; first-year funding to implement the bill is specifically authorized from the 
Information Technology Investment Fund (ITIF). The bill also establishes the Maryland 
Office of Digital Experience (MODE) within the Department of Information Technology 
(DoIT), establishes the Information Technology Advisement Board (ITAB) within the 
Department of Legislative Services (DLS), and repeals the Modernize Maryland 
Commission (MMC). The bill takes effect June 1, 2025. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  No effect assumed for FY 2025. Special fund (ITIF) expenditures increase 
by at least $4.3 million in FY 2026 for staffing; these expenditures are budgeted, contingent 
on enactment of this bill or its cross file. Special fund expenditures for the out-years likely 
increase by at least that amount, but a reliable estimate is not feasible, as discussed below. 
To the extent ITIF funds are not available, general funds are needed. DLS can likely staff 
ITAB using existing budgeted resources. Potential reductions in IT expenditures across 
State agencies resulting from economies of scale and efficiencies cannot be predicted 
absent actual experience under the bill but may be significant; they are not reflected in this 
analysis. No effect on revenues.  
  
Local Effect:  The bill does not directly affect local government operations or finances. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None.

The following sections include more detailed discussions of some of the bill’s provisions, 
as appropriate. 
 
Oversight of Implementation 
 
“Oversight of implementation” means management of the process to implement a new 
technology, system, or product into practice and use by a unit of State government. It 
includes planning and preparation to implement the product or practice and ongoing 
monitoring and support of the implementation team to ensure successful execution and that 
the project goals are met. It does not include responsibility for (1) day-to-day management 
of any individual projects or products or (2) responsibility for implementing 
individual-level process requirements for a project or product. 
 
Major Information Technology Development Projects and Project Funding 
 
As part of the Secretary of Information Technology’s responsibilities related to the review, 
approval, and oversight of major IT development projects, the Secretary must ensure that 
no funding is provided for a project unless: 
 
 
the Secretary determines that the unit has the internal capacity to adequately support 
the project, program management, and responsibility over program activities, 
including human capital, subject matter expertise, and technical infrastructure; 
 
within 30 days after awarding a contract, the managing unit sends to the Board of 
Public Works (BPW) and the Legislative Policy Committee (LPC) a notice that 
identifies the project management team, affirms that DoIT has reviewed and 
approved the contract, and is signed by the head of the unit acknowledging and 
accepting accountability for the implementation of the project or product; and 
 
while a unit is managing an active project or product, the unit agrees to report to 
DoIT every three months on the project status in a manner requested by DoIT.  
 
The Secretary of Budget and Management must withhold any unexpended funds 
appropriated in a fiscal year for a major IT development project at the Secretary of 
Information Technology’s recommendation. However, the Secretary of Budget and 
Management may release funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Information 
Technology if the Secretary of Information Technology determines that the issue leading 
to the initial withholding of funds has been addressed. Within 30 days after any such 
funding is withheld, DoIT must report on the purpose of the withholding to the Governor 
and specified committees of the General Assembly.  
 
The Secretary of Information Technology may recommend to the Secretary of Budget and 
Management that withheld funding be reallocated to other ITIF expenses and the Secretary 
of Budget and Management may, at his or her discretion, follow the recommendation. 

END OF PAGE 3

HB 738/ Page 4 
However, if the reallocated funds exceed $500,000, the Secretary of Information 
Technology must, in consultation with the Secretary of Budget and Management, submit a 
proposal to LPC for a 60-day review and comment period.  
 
Maryland Office of Digital Experience 
 
MODE is established to (1) provide oversight, leadership, intervention, and strategic 
modernization for major IT development projects, including large-scale, high impact, 
multi-agency projects, in a transparent manner that ensures a positive return on investment 
and (2) direct the development of modernized systems in a specified manner. The Secretary 
of Information Technology must appoint a Chief Digital Experience Officer to serve as the 
head of the office.  
 
The office may employ or retain regular or contractual employees at the discretion of the 
Chief Digital Services Officer and Chief of MIDPOD as necessary to meet the 
requirements of the office. The officer and chief may set the compensation for office 
employees, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Budget and Management. The office 
may use a short-term contract or contractual hiring to support human resource needs to 
support the rapid hiring of office employees or contractors.  
 
The office may require a unit of State government to provide reimbursement for services 
provided from funds provided to the unit from ITIF or other funds allocated to the unit for 
an IT project or product. 
 
 
Maryland Digital Service Unit 
 
MDSU is established as a unit within MODE and must collaborate with units of State 
government to support improved service delivery to State residents and agency staff to 
implement user-centered design, software development, and project management best 
practices. MDSU is responsible for (1) assisting units of State government to prioritize the 
development and procurement of user-friendly, accessible, and multilingual digital 
platforms to ensure that all State residents, including those with disabilities, can easily 
access and use government services and information; (2) working collaboratively with 
units of State government to consolidate and streamline State websites and digital 
applications to reduce redundancy, complexity, and maintenance costs and prioritize 
projects that are financially efficient and drive positive outcomes for State residents; and  
(3) overseeing the implementation of user-centered design principles, accessibility 
standards, and best practices across units of State government.

HB 738/ Page 5 
 
Major IT Development Project Oversight Division 
 
MIDPOD is established as a division within MODE and must consult with DoIT to: 
 
 
adopt new standards with which major IT development projects and expedited 
projects are required to comply, in alignment with the State System Development 
Life Cycle; 
 
monitor the performance of project management teams for major IT development 
projects and expedited projects and ensure the teams have the appropriate talent and 
expertise necessary to deliver the intended project value; and  
 
provide expertise, support, and intervention as necessary for the project 
management team to successfully implement a project in a manner consistent with 
any standards adopted.  
 
The division must establish and staff a discovery team to deploy team members to help 
units of State government identify (1) the problem that an IT project or product is solving; 
(2) the likely users of the project or product; (3) what a successful solution looks like; and  
(4) other issues to ensure successful implementation of the project or product. The 
Secretary of Information Technology may delegate any major IT development project to 
the division that the Secretary determines is appropriate to serve as a pilot project for the 
division to provide these services.  
 
Information Technology Investment Fund – Reports and Published Information 
 
The bill repeals one of the two annual reports that DoIT must complete about projects that 
receive funding from ITIF and, instead, expands the information that must be included in 
the other report (which is due by January 15 of each year). Specifically, the bill requires 
the report to include:   
 
 
additional details about ITIF project funding and project status; 
 
additional details about the risk assessment that must be undertaken for the project; 
and 
 
specified project tracking metrics. 
 
The bill specifies that this report (1) is confidential; (2) must communicate the requisite 
information in a clear and concise manner that, to the greatest extent possible, avoids the 
use of technical language or reliance on existing industry knowledge; and (3) include an 
executive summary of key information, as specified. 
 
Additionally, DoIT must publish and maintain a publicly available project and portfolio 
dashboard on its website. The dashboard must include, for each major IT development 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 738/ Page 6 
project and expedited project specified information about each project, organized by the 
accountable unit of State government. DoIT may redact specific risks identified from the 
dashboard if it determines that public sharing of the information could pose a risk to the 
project. If a risk is redacted, the information must still be shared with LPC. Any redacted 
risk is confidential, as specified.  
 
Department of General Services Reporting 
 
Beginning December 31, 2025, and each July 1 and December 31 thereafter, DGS must, in 
consultation with DoIT, report to specified committees of the General Assembly on any 
projects over $1.0 million undertaken by a unit of State government under a master contract 
for Statewide Agile Resources and Teams contract or work order approved by BPW in 
fiscal 2025, as specified.  
 
Information Technology Advisory Board 
 
ITAB is established as an expert advisory entity to the General Assembly and to review 
any State reports or other available information regarding existing major IT development 
projects, including specified documents. The board must be staffed by DLS. A member of 
the board may not receive compensation as a member of the board but is entitled to 
reimbursement for expenses. By December 15 each year, the board must submit to LPC 
and the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Biotechnology a 
report that: 
 
 
interprets and summarizes the reports and other information that it has reviewed;  
 
provides advice to the State based on the reports and other information reviewed; 
and  
 
communicates the requisite information in a clear and concise manner that, to the 
greatest extent possible, avoids the use of technical language or reliance on existing 
industry knowledge.  
 
A member of the board is subject to the public ethics law and must disclose to the State 
Ethics Commission if the member (1) is employed by an entity that currently does business 
with the State that is related to the matters before the board or (2) has a financial interest 
in an entity that currently does business with the State that is related to the matters before 
the board.  
 
Staff and Funding Requirements Related to the Bill 
 
By June 30, 2026, the Secretary of Budget and Management may, with the approval of the 
Governor, transfer by budget amendment to MODE the following appropriations in the 
fiscal 2026 operating budget to implement the bill: 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 738/ Page 7 
 
up to $4.3 million in staff augmentation funds; and 
 
up to 20% of the remaining appropriation to ITIF. 
 
Additionally, by June 30, 2026, the Governor may transfer to MODE up to 50 vacant or 
filled positions and the associated funds and unexpended appropriations that were included 
in the fiscal 2026 operating budget. An individual who is a permanent or contractual staff 
member in a budgeted position in DoIT or a unit of the State Executive Branch who is 
transferred to the Maryland Department of Transportation must be transferred without any 
decrease to or loss of the individual’s rights, pay, status, working conditions, benefits, or 
retirement benefit status.  
 
In fiscal 2026, except for funds otherwise transferred pursuant to the bill, no additional 
general funds beyond those appropriated for DoIT in the fiscal 2026 operating budget may 
be used to implement the bill.  
 
Additional Department of Information Technology Responsibilities 
 
In fiscal 2026, DoIT must (1) work with units of State government to find economies of 
scale through use of one statewide productivity suite under one State license, but may 
provide for specific exceptions as necessary to meet specific unit needs; (2) identify any 
other technology licensing or costs that could be reduced with a statewide contract for 
licensing or services; and (3) provide that any such savings accrue to ITIF to assist in 
implementing the bill.  
 
Legislative Workgroup 
 
The Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and House Health and Government 
Operations Committee must convene a workgroup to evaluate the provisions of the bill, 
including (1) the duties and responsibilities that should be assigned to DoIT, MODE, 
MIDPOD, MDSU, or other offices in DoIT; (2) what if any additional actions should be 
taken to ensure adequate resolution of the findings made by the Office of Legislative Audits 
in 2024; (3) whether it would be efficient and effective to have a DoIT employee embedded 
on site in units of State government with a major IT development project to assist in project 
management to provide expertise, and to serve as a liaison between the unit and DoIT; 
(4) whether additional or independent procurement authority should be given to DoIT; and 
(5) whether there are more efficient and effective ways or mechanisms including 
establishment of an independent IT project management authority, to provide project and 
program management implementation.

Information Technology Investment Fund – Generally 
 
To centralize State oversight and funding for major Executive Branch IT projects, 
Chapters 467 and 468 of 2002 established a review and approval process for major IT 
development projects and the related Major IT Development Fund. Chapter 497 of 2024 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 738/ Page 9 
made various changes to the fund, including renaming it as ITIF. Under Chapter 497, the 
purpose of ITIF is to support both major IT development projects and expedited projects. 
ITIF is managed by DoIT and may be used only for major IT development projects, 
maintenance costs for major IT development projects for a specified time period, expedited 
projects, administrative costs, and costs for specified pilot programs and prototypes. 
 
For a project to be eligible for funding through ITIF, it must (1) be estimated to cost at least  
$5.0 million; (2) support critical business functions associated with the public health, 
education, safety, or financial well-being of the citizens of Maryland; or (3) be determined 
to require special attention and consideration by the Secretary of Information Technology. 
An expedited project is a project that is not a major IT development project but receives 
money from ITIF in a manner that allows for modernization projects to move forward in a 
nimble and expedited manner. Each fiscal year, at least 20% of ITIF funds must be set 
aside for expedited projects. 
 
In order to request funding for a project from ITIF, a State agency must follow a specified 
statutory process. The Secretary of Information Technology must review the requests and, 
with the advice of the Secretary of Budget and Management, approve projects and 
specifications for consistency with all statewide plans, polices, and standards, including a 
systems development life cycle plan. The Secretary of Information Technology must be 
responsible for overseeing the implementation of major IT development projects, 
regardless of fund source.  
 
The Secretary of Information Technology must make a recommendation to the Secretary 
of Budget and Management to withhold project funding from ITIF under certain 
circumstances.  
 
Information Technology Investment Fund – Reports  
 
DoIT is required to submit two annual reports about ITIF and the projects that receive 
funding through ITIF. The first report is due by November 1 of each year and must include 
(1) the financial status of ITIF and a summary of its operations for the preceding 
fiscal year; (2) an accounting for the preceding fiscal year of all money from specified 
revenue sources, including any expenditures made from the fund; and (3) specified 
information for each project receiving ITIF funds in the preceding fiscal year. 
 
The second report is due by January 15 each year and must include, for each project 
receiving funding from ITIF, the most up-to-date project information including (1) project 
funding decisions and project status; (2) any schedule, cost, and scope changes since the 
last annual report; (3) a risk assessment, including any problems identified by any internal 
or external review and any corrective actions taken; and (4) any change in the monitoring 
or oversight status.

HB 738/ Page 10 
Modernize Maryland Commission 
 
The purpose of MMC is to recommend best practices related to the modernization and the 
replacement of legacy systems. The commission must (1) identify best practices for IT 
modernization and the replacement of legacy systems; (2) provide recommendations for 
modernization of IT systems to the Governor, the Secretary of Information Technology, 
and the General Assembly; (3) provide recommendations to promote transparency in 
modernization efforts in units of State government; and (4) submit an annual report of its 
findings and recommendations to specified committees of the General Assembly. MMC 
must be staffed by DoIT, in consultation with DLS. 
 
State Expenditures:  DoIT advises that many of the bill’s requirements can be handled 
using existing budgeted resources but that any additional resources needed to implement 
other provisions of the bill are covered in fiscal 2026 by funds available for transfer from 
ITIF and included in the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the General Assembly, as 
discussed below. Out-year funding is also discussed below.  
 
DoIT anticipates that some additional staffing may be needed specifically to staff discovery 
teams required by the bill because it does not currently have any staff available to serve on 
those teams. Depending on how many staff are ultimately needed by DoIT, which depends 
on numerous unknown factors (including, for the discovery teams, how many State 
agencies require DoIT’s assistance), total staffing costs may exceed $1.0 million annually.  
 
Nevertheless, DoIT advises, and DLS concurs, that the ITIF funding authorized to be 
transferred to implement the bill for fiscal 2026 is sufficient to cover any additional staffing 
costs that DoIT may incur in fiscal 2026. Specifically, the fiscal 2026 budget as passed by 
the General Assembly restricts $4.3 million of the appropriation to ITIF to be used only by 
MDSU, contingent on the enactment of this bill or its cross file. As this bill effectuates the 
contingent authorization to transfer those funds, this analysis assumes that the Governor 
transfers at least $4.3 million to MDSU in fiscal 2026 to implement the requirements of 
the bill. Those funds are likely sufficient to cover any personnel costs incurred by DoIT, 
but to the extent they are not, the Governor is authorized to transfer to MODE up to an 
additional 20% of funds appropriated to ITIF, which are also available for use by MDSU. 
Moreover, to the extent that any positions are transferred from other State agencies, along 
with the associated appropriations (which is also authorized by the bill), the impact on ITIF 
may be less pronounced. However, DLS notes that only up to 50 such positions may be 
transferred.  
 
In the out-years, the bill authorizes a unit of State government to reimburse MODE for 
services provided to the unit from ITIF funds allocated to the unit for an IT project or 
product. Therefore, this analysis assumes that costs for new MODE staff, including 
discovery teams, that provide services related to IT projects or products to units of State 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
HB 738/ Page 11 
government continue to be paid using ITIF funds dedicated to those projects or products. 
DLS notes that the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2025 (HB 352) as passed 
by the General Assembly repeals the 20% set-aside for expedited projects, making those 
funds available for this purpose. However, to the extent there is not sufficient funding in 
ITIF or if services provided by MODE are not directly related to an ITIF-funded project, 
additional general funds may be needed instead. 
 
Additional Comments:  DoIT advises that the ITIF project and portfolio dashboard 
required by the bill may take at least one year to fully develop and publish. The bill does 
not provide a deadline for completion of the dashboard.
