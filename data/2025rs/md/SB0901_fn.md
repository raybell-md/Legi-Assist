FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
Senate Bill 901 
(Senator Augustine, et al.) 
Education, Energy, and the Environment 
Environment and Transportation and 
Economic Matters 
 
Environment - Packaging and Paper Products - Producer Responsibility Plans 
 
 
This bill alters provisions relating to the existing Producer Responsibility Advisory 
Council and establishes a required framework for producers of covered materials to create 
and implement producer responsibility plans. The producer responsibility organization 
approved by Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) pursuant to current law 
must register annually beginning July 1, 2026. Producer responsibility plans must be 
submitted by each producer to MDE for review and approval by July 1, 2028. Beginning 
on a date set by MDE, a producer may not sell, offer for sale, distribute, or import for sale 
or distribution covered materials for use in the State unless the producer has an approved 
plan. The bill also, among other things, requires MDE to develop a statewide list of covered 
materials and establishes provisions relating to (1) service providers; (2) an ongoing 
statewide recycling needs assessment; and (3) enforcement. MDE must adopt 
implementing regulations. The bill takes effect June 1, 2025. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  No effect in FY 2025. Special fund expenditures increase by $212,800 in 
FY 2026; out-years reflect annualization, inflation, ongoing costs, and new staff in 
FY 2027 and 2029. Special fund revenues increase by $667,000 in FY 2026 from a certain 
fee; out-years reflect ongoing fee revenues, which increase correspondingly to MDE’s 
costs beginning in FY 2027. State expenditures (multiple funds) may increase beginning

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  It is the intent of the General Assembly that Title 9, Subtitle 25 of the 
Environment Article, as altered by the bill, provide a framework for (1) minimizing the 
environmental and human health impacts of packaging, as specified; (2) conserving 
resources by increasing the recycling rates and recycled content of covered products; 
(3) modernizing and improving waste and recycling systems in the State, as specified; and 
(4) making producers financially responsible for investing in the needed infrastructure and 
reimbursing local governments and other service providers for costs associated with 
transporting, collecting, and processing covered materials. 
 
Subtitle 25 does not affect the authority of the State or a local jurisdiction to regulate the 
sale or use of any packaging material. Further, Subtitle 25 may not be construed to 
(1) prohibit a local government, a service provider, or any other entity from selling recycled 
materials or compost to end markets and retaining the revenues from those sales; (2) affect 
the authority of a publicly or privately owned materials recycling facility or composting 
facility to determine which entities may use the facility; (3) limit the ability of local 
governments, materials recycling facilities, or composting facilities to make decisions on 
recycling infrastructure purchases, including processing equipment; or (4) preclude the 
State from adopting a separate beverage container deposit return program to reduce 
beverage container pollution and plastic waste. 
 
Key Definitions 
 
The bill alters the definition of “producer” that was established under Chapter 465 of 2023 
– in general, a producer is the person responsible for compliance with a producer 
responsibility plan – and generally includes brand owners, manufacturers, or importers, as 
further delineated by the bill based on, among other things, whether the item is (1) sold in 
or with packaging at a physical retail location in the State or (2) sold or distributed in 
packaging in or into the State via e-commerce, remote sale, or online distribution. For 
packaging that is not described under those provisions, the producer of the packaging is 
the person that first distributes the item in or into the State, and for paper products, the 
producer is generally either the publisher, the manufacturer, the brand owner, or the 
importer of the paper product. 
 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
SB 901/ Page 3 
The definition of “producer” is further altered to exclude the following entities:   
 
 
a state, federal or state agency, a political subdivision, or other governmental unit;  
 
a registered 501(c)(3) charitable organization or a 501(c)(4) social welfare 
organization;  
 
a “de minimis producer,” defined as a person that in their most recent fiscal year, 
introduced less than one ton of covered material into the State or earned global gross 
revenues of less than $2.0 million;  
 
a mill that uses any virgin wood fiber in the product it produces;  
 
a paper mill that produces container board derived from 100% postconsumer 
recycled content and nonpostconsumer recycled content;  
 
an entity that owns or operates a restaurant, food cart, or similar establishment that 
is headquartered in the State, primarily sells food to members of the public, as 
specified, and is not a producer of food serviceware;  
 
an entity that owns or operates a single retail sales establishment that has no online 
sales and is not supplied or operated as part of a franchise or chain;  
 
an entity that is licensed under Title 2 of the Alcoholic Beverages and Cannabis 
Article and generated less than $10.0 million in gross revenue during the 
immediately preceding calendar year; or  
 
a producer that has executed an agreement with another entity, under which the 
other entity has agreed to assume responsibility by written certification under a 
producer responsibility program for any packaging materials attributable to the first 
entity. 
 
“Producer responsibility plan” means a covered materials producer responsibility plan 
submitted by a producer or producer responsibility organization in accordance with the bill. 
 
“Covered entity” means a person or location that receives “covered services” for “covered 
materials” in accordance with Subtitle 25, including a single-family or multifamily 
residence, a public or nonpublic kindergarten, elementary school, or secondary school, a 
child care center, and a public building owned or operated by the State or a local 
government. 
 
“Covered services” means (1) collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, 
recovering, preparing, or otherwise managing covered materials for purposes of waste 
reduction, reuse, recycling, or composting and (2) public education and outreach activities 
related to those activities. The term does not include disposal of covered materials. 
 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
SB 901/ Page 4 
“Covered materials” means packaging and paper products sold, offered for sale, imported, 
or distributed in the State; the term does not include “exempt materials,” as further defined. 
Generally, “exempt materials” includes packaging for:   
 
 
infant formula, medical food, and fortified oral nutritional supplements or food that 
is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally, as specified;  
 
specified products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency;  
 
liquefied petroleum gas containers that are designed to be refilled;  
 
certain federally regulated hazardous and flammable products; 
 
newsprint and paper products used for a magazine’s print publication, as specified;  
 
the containment of hazardous or flammable products, as specified; and 
 
the long-term protection or storage of a product that has a lifespan of at least 
five years, as determined by MDE. 
 
In addition, packaging for products subject to the State’s Paint Stewardship Program, and 
certain material that is distributed from one producer to another, are considered “exempt 
materials.” 
 
“Service provider” means an entity that provides covered services for covered materials; 
the term includes a local government that provides, contracts for, or otherwise arranges 
with another party to provide covered services for covered materials within its jurisdiction 
regardless of whether the local government provided, contracted for, or otherwise arranged 
for similar services before the approval of the applicable producer responsibility plan. 
 
Producer Responsibility Advisory Council 
 
The bill alters provisions related to the membership, stated purpose, and duties of the 
Producer Responsibility Advisory Council that was established pursuant to Chapter 465. 
Under the bill, the stated purpose of the advisory council is to provide advice and make 
recommendations regarding establishing and implementing a producer responsibility 
program in the State for covered (rather than packaging) materials, include providing 
advice on drafting, amending, and implementing producer responsibility plans. 
 
The bill repeals the existing duty of the advisory council (which, under current law, is to 
evaluate and make recommendations, including legislative recommendations, on how to 
effectively establish and implement a producer responsibility program in the State for 
packaging materials). It also repeals a related reporting requirement. Under the bill, the 
advisory council must (1) provide advice regarding the drafting or amending of a producer 
responsibility plan, on request of a producer or producer responsibility organization; 
(2) receive and review the producer responsibility plans and annual reports submitted in 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
SB 901/ Page 5 
accordance with the bill; (3) make recommendations to MDE regarding producer 
responsibility plan approval; (4) make recommendations to MDE and producer 
responsibility organizations regarding plan implementation; and (5) provide written 
recommendations regarding the producer responsibility plan, including any update or 
revision to an approved plan, to a producer responsibility organization before the plan is 
submitted to MDE. 
 
Registration of Producer Responsibility Organizations 
 
Beginning July 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, the producer responsibility organization 
(already approved by MDE pursuant to current law) must file a registration form with MDE 
and pay an annual registration fee to cover specified administrative costs. More 
specifically, the annual fee must be set by MDE in an amount sufficient to cover (in each 
year) record-keeping costs (not to exceed $1,000) and the costs of developing and updating 
a statewide list of covered materials determined to be recyclable or compostable through 
curbside recycling programs, as required by the bill and discussed in more detail below. 
Additionally, as necessary, the fee must cover the costs of developing and implementing 
regulations that MDE must adopt to carry out Title 9, Subtitle 25 of the Environment 
Article. Finally, beginning in 2028, the fee must cover the costs of registering service 
providers under the bill. The registration form must include specified information, 
including a list of the producers participating in the producer responsibility organization. 
 
Beginning July 1, 2033, a nonprofit organization may request that MDE designate the 
nonprofit organization as an additional producer responsibility organization. MDE may 
designate an additional producer responsibility organization if MDE determines, in 
coordination with the advisory council, that the designation is necessary to increase 
recycling rates or improve recycling services for a specific type of covered material. If 
MDE approves the designation of an additional producer responsibility organization, the 
producer responsibility organization must (1) register with MDE within 30 days of 
approval (and by July 1 annually thereafter) and (2) pay the annual registration fee. The 
registration form must include specified information. Any additional producer 
responsibility organizations must coordinate with the original producer responsibility 
organization established under the bill, MDE, and local governments, as specified. 
 
The original producer responsibility organization and any additional producer 
responsibility organizations designated as described above may create a representative 
organization to represent the participating producer responsibility organizations to 
implement the bill’s requirements. 
 
Alternative Collection Programs 
 
Beginning July 1, 2026, and in accordance with the bill and any regulations adopted by 
MDE, a producer or group of producers may develop and operate an alternative collection 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
SB 901/ Page 6 
program to collect and manage a type or types of covered material sold, offered for sale, or 
distributed for sale in or into the State by the producer or producers. If a producer manages 
a type of covered material under an alternative collection program through reuse, recycling, 
or composting, this action may wholly or in part offset the producer’s payment obligations 
under the bill. 
 
Development, Review, and Implementation of Producer Responsibility Plans 
 
Submission of Plans:  By July 1, 2028, and every five years thereafter, each producer must 
submit a producer responsibility plan to MDE for review and approval (either individually 
or as part of a producer responsibility organization). Before submitting a plan to MDE for 
review, a producer or producer responsibility organization must consult with, consider 
written recommendations from, and respond in writing to the advisory council. 
 
General Prohibition on the Sale or Distribution of Covered Materials Unless Producer 
Has an Approved Plan:  Beginning on a certain date determined by MDE and established 
in regulation, a producer may not sell, offer for sale, distribute, or import for sale or 
distribution covered materials for use in the State unless the producer has an approved 
producer responsibility plan on file with MDE (either individually or as part of a producer 
responsibility organization). However, a producer is not required to submit a producer 
responsibility plan to MDE (individually or as part of a producer responsibility 
organization) if another person has agreed to assume responsibility for the producer’s 
covered material, as specified. 
 
Content of Plans:  The bill establishes the minimum content for a producer responsibility 
plan. Among other things, the plan must (1) identify the producers and brands covered by 
the plan, as specified; (2) include a number of performance goals that are achievable within 
five years and are relevant and appropriate for each covered material type (that do not apply 
in certain circumstances); (3) include performance standards for service providers as 
applicable to the service provider, as specified; (4) include the written recommendations 
from the advisory council, the producer responsibility organization’s written response, and 
how the written recommendations were considered and addressed in the development plan; 
(5) explain how the program will be paid for by the producer responsibility organization 
through fees from producers, as specified; and (6) any other information required by MDE. 
 
The plan must also describe, among other things, (1) the financing method that will be used 
to implement the plan (discussed in more detail below); (2) how, for each covered material 
type, the producer responsibility organization will measure recycling, waste reduction, 
reuse, composting, and the inclusion of postconsumer recycled content; (3) infrastructure 
investments, as specified; (4) how the performance goals will be met or exceeded; (5) how 
the producer responsibility organization will provide technical assistance to service 
providers in order to assist then in delivering covered materials to responsible end markets; 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
SB 901/ Page 7 
(6) how staffing and administering the implementation of the plan will be handled; (7) the 
actions taken or that will be taken for public outreach, education, and communication, as 
specified; (8) the amount of funding that will be used to improve reuse, composting, and 
recycling in the State; and (9) the process by which a service provider may request 
reimbursement for costs associated with transporting, collecting, and processing covered 
materials that are identified in the plan, as specified. 
 
Financing and Reimbursement Rates:  The financing method that will be used by a 
producer responsibility organization to implement a producer responsibility plan must, 
among other things, (1) provide the method for either direct investments or reimbursements 
for improving infrastructure improvements, as specified; (2) provide for a methodology for 
reimbursement rates for covered services for covered materials, exclusive of exempt 
materials and producers; and (3) establish a fee structure for participating producers, as 
specified; the producer responsibility organization must take specified actions before 
establishing the fee structure. The financing method must be evaluated by an 
MDE-designated independent financial auditor to ensure that the costs of implementing the 
plan are covered. 
 
The funding that will be used for improving reuse, composting, and recycling must include 
investment in market development and existing and future reuse, composting, and 
recycling infrastructure, as specified, giving priority to existing infrastructure. 
 
A producer responsibility organization must retain any fee collected in its own account, 
and a service provider must retain all revenue from the sale of covered materials. MDE 
may request an audit of a producer responsibility organization’s financial records at any 
time. Nothing in Subtitle 25 may be construed to restrict a service provider from charging 
a fee for covered services of covered materials to the extent that reimbursement from a 
producer responsibility organization does not cover all costs of services, as specified.  
 
Regarding the mandatory reimbursement rate, the reimbursement rate is phased in, and the 
required level of reimbursement increases over the time; specifically, the reimbursement 
rate must be equivalent to the following percentages of costs:   
 
 
by July 1, 2028, reimburse at least 50% of the cost per ton;  
 
by July 1, 2029, reimburse at least 75% of the cost per ton; and 
 
by July 1, 2030, and each year thereafter, reimburse at least 90% of the cost per ton. 
 
Additionally, the reimbursement rate must be based on specified factors, as applicable, that 
broadly relate to (1) fixed amounts for each ton of covered material collected, processed, 
and otherwise managed by the service providers; (2) the value of the materials that were 
managed; (3) administrative costs, including costs to conduct education, public awareness 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
SB 901/ Page 8 
campaigns, and outreach, as applicable; and (4) a fixed amount for costs to manage covered 
materials capable of being refilled and reused (and specified related costs). 
 
Regarding the fee structure for participating producers, the fee must be set in a manner to 
cover costs associated with (1) implementing the plan, including the administrative costs 
of a producer responsibility organization; (2) reimbursing service providers; (3) the 
administration, review, oversight, and enforcement of the plan by MDE; and 
(4) implementing the strategy in the plan for improving reuse, composting, and recycling 
in the State. Additionally, the fee structure must be variable based on (1) costs associated 
with transporting, collecting, and processing covered materials; (2) an eco-modulation of 
fees, based on the recycled content of the covered materials; and (3) any other factor, as 
determined by MDE. 
 
Performance Goals:  Based on the results of the most recent statewide recycling needs 
assessment conducted pursuant to Chapter 465 or the bill (discussed below), MDE, in 
coordination with a producer responsibility organization and via the approval of producer 
responsibility plans, must establish performance goals for each covered material type using 
a baseline year that is informed by the needs assessment, including establishing recycling 
rate goals for each covered material type at 5-, 10-, and 15-year intervals. 
 
Review of Plans and Auditor’s Work Product:  MDE must review the producer 
responsibility plan, and within 120 days, either approve, approve with conditions, or reject 
a plan submitted for review. The bill establishes several considerations MDE must take 
into account when making a determination regarding a producer responsibility plan. Within 
60 days of plan approval, the entity that submitted the plan must pay to MDE (1) MDE’s 
cost of reviewing the plan and (2) MDE’s estimated costs to administer, oversee, and 
enforce the plan between the initial approval date and the date of the initial annual report 
required by the bill. 
 
In addition to reviewing the producer responsibility plan(s), MDE must also review the 
work product of the independent financial auditor designated by MDE to evaluate the 
financing component of the producer responsibility plan(s). 
 
Plan Implementation:  The implementation of an approved producer responsibility plan 
must begin no later than six months after the date the plan is approved by MDE. An 
approved plan expires after five years, but MDE may rescind approval of a plan at any time 
for good cause. Additionally, a producer responsibility plan may continue beyond 
five years if it is renegotiated, renewed, or amended and approved by MDE in accordance 
with the bill. If, based on the annual report submitted, specified performance goals have 
not been met, MDE may require a plan amendment or impose an administrative penalty on 
a producer or producer responsibility organization (discussed more below). If MDE 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
SB 901/ Page 9 
requires a producer or producer responsibility organization to amend a plan, the producer 
or producer responsibility organization must cover MDE’s costs, as specified. 
 
Annual Reports:  Beginning July 1, 2029, each producer or producer responsibility 
organization that has an approved producer responsibility plan on file with MDE must 
report annually to MDE on the progress toward meeting plan requirements and goals for 
the immediately preceding calendar year. The annual report must include specified 
information. Any financial, production, or sales data reported to MDE by a producer or 
producer responsibility organization must be kept confidential, as specified. Other than 
confidential information, the annual report must be posted on MDE’s website and the 
website of the producer or producer responsibility organization. Along with the annual 
report, a producer or producer responsibility organization must also submit payment for 
MDE’s estimated costs of administering, overseeing, and enforcing the plan for the next 
year. 
 
Review by Office of Recycling:  MDE’s Office of Recycling is tasked with reviewing and 
approving, in consultation with the advisory council, producer responsibility plans and 
annual reports. 
 
Service Provider Reimbursement and Registration 
 
In accordance with the requirements of a producer responsibility organization, as 
established in an approved plan on file with MDE, and any other requirement adopted by 
MDE, a service provider may request reimbursement from a producer responsibility 
organization for costs associated with collecting, transporting, and processing covered 
materials that are identified under the plan, as specified. 
 
If multiple producer responsibility organizations register approved producer responsibility 
plans with MDE, the producer responsibility organizations (1) must coordinate 
reimbursement requested pursuant to this provision and (2) may establish a third-party 
entity to coordinate reimbursement. A service provider is not authorized to request 
reimbursement for costs associated with composting materials that are not covered 
materials. 
 
By January 1, 2029, and each January 1 thereafter, a service provider seeking 
reimbursement for services provided under an approved plan must register with MDE by 
submitting specified information. The bill also establishes various duties for a service 
provider that receives reimbursement or funding under an approved producer responsibility 
plan. Among other things, a service provider must submit invoices for reimbursement, 
ensure that covered materials are sent to responsible end markets, provide specified 
documentation to the producer responsibility organization, and otherwise comply with all 
other applicable requirements. A service provider may designate any proprietary 

END OF PAGE 9

START OF PAGE 10
    
SB 901/ Page 10 
information provided to MDE or a person determining reimbursement rates as confidential. 
Any such information is not subject to disclosure under the Maryland Public Information 
Act but may be disclosed as summarized or aggregated data if doing so does not directly 
or indirectly disclose the proprietary information of any specific facility. 
 
Statewide List of Covered Materials  
 
By July 1, 2027, MDE, in consultation with specified entities, including the advisory 
council, producer responsibility organizations, service providers, and local governments, 
must develop a statewide list of covered materials determined to be recyclable or 
compostable through curbside programs. In developing the list, MDE may consider 
specified criteria. Covered materials in the list must be collected at an optimal level of 
service and convenience for covered entities and, at a minimum, wherever collection 
services for mixed municipal solid waste are available. 
 
MDE may amend the list at any time and must provide an amended list to producer 
responsibility organizations within a reasonable amount of time (as determined by MDE) 
after amending the list. Upon receipt of an amended list, a producer responsibility 
organization must provide the list to service providers as soon as practicable and work to 
incorporate changes in relevant service provider reimbursement rates within 
one calendar year. 
 
A producer may request that MDE classify one or more types of packaging as an exempt 
material. MDE must submit such a request to the advisory council for review and comment 
before approving or denying the request. MDE may only approve the request if it 
determines that a specific federal or State health and safety requirement prevents the 
packaging from being waste reduced or made reuseable, recyclable, or compostable. 
Within 120 days after it receives a request, MDE must review and approve or deny the 
request or request additional information from the producer. MDE must publish and update 
as necessary on its website a list of materials exempted by request under these provisions. 
An exemption expires after two years, but a producer may file a subsequent request for an 
exemption. 
 
Legal Immunities and Enforcement 
 
Any person participating in a producer responsibility plan in compliance with the bill is 
immune from liability under State law relating to antitrust and restraint of trade for any 
cooperated activities arising out of the recycling, reuse, and disposal of covered materials. 
 
Current law provisions under §§ 9-334 through 9-344 of the Environment Article apply to 
enforce violations of Title 9, Subtitle 25 of the Environment Article (as amended by the 
bill) and any regulations adopted or orders issued pursuant to Subtitle 25. In addition, a 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
SB 901/ Page 11 
producer or producer responsibility organization that violates Subtitle 25 is subject to an 
administrative penalty of $5,000 for a first violation, an administrative penalty of 
$10,000 for a second violation, and a civil penalty of $20,000 for a third or subsequent 
violation. Before imposing a penalty on a producer, MDE must first issue a written notice 
of violation to the producer and give the producer an opportunity to correct the violation 
within 60 days after receipt of the written notice. After the 60-day period, each day that a 
violation continues is a separate violation. 
 
As discussed above, MDE may also impose an administrative penalty on a producer 
responsibility organization if, based on the annual report submitted, the performance goals 
established pursuant to the bill have not been achieved. The administrative penalty may 
not exceed $250,000. 
 
Any penalty collected by MDE under these provisions must be paid into the 
State Recycling Trust Fund. 
 
Statewide Recycling Needs Assessments 
 
By July 30, 2034, and at least once every 10 years thereafter, MDE’s Office of Recycling 
must hire an independent consultant to conduct a statewide recycling needs assessment to 
inform the provision of recycling services in the State, including the implementation of 
Subtitle 25. The needs assessment must include specified analyses and evaluations, address 
a variety of topics, and make certain recommendations related to the State’s recycling 
system and extended producer responsibility programs, among other things. The Office of 
Recycling must report the results of each assessment to the Governor and the 
General Assembly. In conducting the assessment, the independent consultant must consult 
with producer responsibility organizations, the advisory council, appropriate local 
government entities, and regional solid waste organizations in the State. The Office of 
Recycling must establish and collect a fee that is paid by producer responsibility 
organizations to cover the costs of conducting the assessment required under Chapter 465 
and each subsequent assessment required under the bill. Fee revenue is paid into the 
State Recycling Trust Fund. 
 
Expanded Fund Sources and Uses of the State Recycling Trust Fund and New Account 
 
The fund sources for the State Recycling Trust Fund are expanded to include any fees 
collected from producer responsibility organizations. The authorized uses of the 
State Recycling Trust Fund are expanded to include covering the cost of conducting the 
statewide recycling needs assessments and producer responsibility plan review, oversight, 
and enforcement. The bill requires the establishment of a separate account within the fund 
that consists of any fees collected from producer responsibility organizations and all fines 
and penalties collected pursuant to the bill’s enforcement provisions. The separate account 

END OF PAGE 11

START OF PAGE 12
    
SB 901/ Page 12 
may only be used for the costs of the statewide needs assessment and producer 
responsibility plan review, oversight, and enforcement. 
 
Future Enactment of a Beverage Container Deposit Program 
 
If a beverage container deposit program is enacted in the State, MDE must coordinate the 
implementation of the program in a manner that ensures compatibility with producer 
responsibility plans and related provisions of law as provided by the bill. MDE must also 
ensure that (1) materials covered in such a program are exempt from producer 
responsibility plans or (2) related financial obligations are reduced. 
 
Current Law:  The solid waste infrastructure in Maryland consists of both permitted and 
nonpermitted facilities, and solid waste is managed through a combination of recycling, 
composting, landfilling, incineration, storage, and exporting for disposal or recycling. 
 
Maryland’s recycling policy is guided by the Maryland Recycling Act (MRA), which sets 
mandatory recycling rates for State government and local jurisdictions, as well as a 
voluntary statewide waste diversion goal of 60% and a voluntary statewide recycling goal 
of 55% by 2020. Each county (including Baltimore City), must recycle at least 20% or 35% 
of the county’s solid waste stream, depending on the county’s population. Each county 
(including Baltimore City) must also prepare a recycling plan that addresses how the 
jurisdiction will achieve its mandatory recycling rate. 
 
The Office of Recycling 
 
MDE’s Office of Recycling, among other things, reviews county recycling plans and 
coordinates the efforts of the State to facilitate the implementation of the recycling goals 
at the county level. Counties are required to periodically report solid waste and recycling 
data to the department. 
 
MDE’s Office of Recycling submits annual reports, in coordination with the Maryland 
Environmental Service, to the Governor and the General Assembly on specified 
information related to recycling in Maryland. Beginning in 2009, MDE has combined the 
Maryland Waste Diversion Activities Report and the Solid Waste Managed in Maryland 
Report into one report, the Maryland Solid Waste Management and Diversion Report. 
 
Chapter 465 required the Office of Recycling to hire an independent consultant to conduct 
a statewide recycling needs assessment, which must, among other things, include 
(1) analysis of the costs and benefits, and potential environmental impact, of implementing 
an extended producer responsibility program for packaging materials (which include 
beverage containers) and (2) recommendations on the best practices to follow from 
successful extended producer responsibility programs in other states and countries. By

also established a Producer Responsibility Advisory Council to provide advice and 
recommendations regarding establishing and implementing a producer responsibility 
program in the State for packaging materials. The advisory council was required to report 
its findings and recommendations to the Governor and specified legislative committees by 
December 1, 2024. The final statewide recycling needs assessment was submitted in 
February 2025, and the advisory council’s report was submitted in March 2025. 
 
State Recycling Trust Fund 
 
The State Recycling Trust Fund is a special fund that is used to:   
 
 
carry out the purposes of MDE’s Land Management Administration; 
 
provide grants to (1) counties to develop and implement local recycling plans; 
(2) counties that have addressed methods for the separate collection and recycling 
of covered electronic devices; and (3) municipalities to be used to implement local 
covered electronic device recycling programs; and 
 
cover specified costs of the Paint Stewardship Program (established under 
Chapters 587 and 588 of 2024). 
 
Relevant Enforcement Provisions 
 
The provisions of §§ 9-334 through 9-341 of the Environment Article, which are 
established under provisions relating to Title 9, Subtitle 3 of the Environment Article 
(Water Pollution Control), establish enforcement procedures that govern (1) the ability of 
MDE to issue complaints, conduct hearings, issue corrective orders, and obtain injunctive 
relief and (2) judicial review of final decisions. 
 
Under § 9-343 of the Environment Article, a person who violates any provision of or fails

State Fiscal Effect:   
 
Maryland Department of the Environment Administrative Costs and Related Fee Revenue 
 
Overview:  The bill contemplates that producer responsibility organizations and producers 
will fully fund, through fees paid to MDE, MDE’s costs to implement the bill. This analysis 
assumes that MDE is able to collect fees each year in an amount sufficient to cover its 
administrative costs, as discussed below. 
 
Administrative Costs:  Special fund expenditures increase by $212,843 in fiscal 2026 
(which accounts for a 120-day start-up delay), by $330,134 in fiscal 2027, by $338,322 in 
fiscal 2028, by $572,322 in fiscal 2029, and by similar amounts annually thereafter. These 
estimates reflect the cost of hiring two natural resource planners and one administrative 
specialist in fiscal 2026, one additional natural resource planner in fiscal 2027, and 
two environmental compliance specialists in fiscal 2029. 
 
The initial two natural resource planners and the administrative specialist are hired in 
fiscal 2026 to begin implementing the bill by (1) conducting outreach and registering the 
producer responsibility organization as well as designating the independent financial 
auditor; (2) developing and promulgating regulations; and (3) providing additional staff 
support for the advisory council. The third natural resource planner is hired in fiscal 2027 
to (along with the initial employees) (1) assist in developing the statewide list of covered 
materials; (2) review producer responsibility plans, the work product of the independent 
financial auditor, and annual reports; (3) track progress of implemented plans; (4) post 
annual reports online; and (5) beginning in fiscal 2029, register service providers. The 
environmental compliance specialists are hired in fiscal 2029 to (1) conduct compliance 
inspections and investigate complaints and (2) generally enforce the bill once the producer 
responsibility plans are in place. These estimates include salaries, fringe benefits, one-time 
start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses. The information and assumptions used in 
calculating the estimate are stated below:   
 
 
pursuant to current law, MDE staffs the advisory council; 
 
the bill applies to a large number of producers, who are not already known by MDE, 
requiring a significant amount of outreach and administrative organization; 
 
MDE must review a relatively large number of producer responsibility plans on an 
ongoing basis; and

 
in order to establish a robust producer responsibility program in the State, 
MDE needs to hire additional staff.

Future year expenditures reflect salaries with annual increases and employee turnover as 
well as annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. As noted above, it is assumed that 
all costs incurred by MDE are covered with special funds. 
 
Special Fund Revenues from Fees:  In fiscal 2026, special fund revenues from a certain 
fee, which total an estimated $667,000, are higher than MDE’s estimated costs in that year. 
Beginning in fiscal 2027, fee revenues are assumed to increase correspondingly to MDE’s 
administrative costs in each year (as estimated above). The relevant fee provisions – and 
resulting fiscal effects – are described in more detail below. 
 
The bill authorizes MDE’s Office of Recycling to set a fee to cover the costs associated 
with conducting the statewide needs assessment required pursuant to Chapter 465. MDE 
advises that those costs totaled approximately $667,000. While the bill does not specify 
the timing of when this fee is to be imposed, MDE advises that it plans to collect this fee 
from the approved producer responsibility organization in fiscal 2026. Accordingly, special 
fund revenues from that fee increase by an estimated $667,000 in fiscal 2026. 
 
Beginning July 1, 2026 (fiscal 2027), and annually thereafter, the producer responsibility 
organization must pay an annual registration fee that is set by MDE in an amount sufficient 
to cover (in each year) record-keeping costs (not to exceed $1,000) and the costs of 
developing and updating a statewide list of covered materials determined to be recyclable 
or compostable through curbside recycling programs. Additionally, as necessary, the fee 
must cover the costs of developing and implementing the regulations MDE is required to 
adopt to carry out the program.  
 
Beginning in calendar 2028 (fiscal 2029), the registration fee paid by the producer 
responsibility organization must also cover the costs of registering service providers. In 
addition, in fiscal 2029, each entity that submits a producer responsibility plan to MDE for 
review and approval (i.e., each producer individually or as part of a producer responsibility 
organization) must pay MDE for its plan review costs and the estimated costs to administer, 
oversee, and enforce the plan between the initial date of approval and the initial annual 
report submission (July 1, 2029). In future fiscal years, when submitting their annual 
reports, a producer or producer responsibility organization must pay to MDE the 

END OF PAGE 15

START OF PAGE 16
    
SB 901/ Page 16 
department’s estimated costs to administer, oversee, and enforce the plan for the 
following year. MDE may also recoup any additional plan review costs associated with 
amended producer responsibility plans and any related supplemental work. 
 
Based on the fee provisions as described above, this analysis assumes that MDE is able to 
collect sufficient fees to fully cover its administrative costs each year. 
 
State Agencies as Consumers of Affected Products 
 
State expenditures (multiple fund types) could increase, likely not until fiscal 2029, due to 
any increase in the price to purchase covered materials that may result from the bill. 
However, the magnitude of any such increase in costs is unknown and depends largely on 
the specifics of the approved producer responsibility plans. 
 
Penalty Provisions 
 
Special fund revenues to the State Recycling Trust Fund may increase minimally, likely 
not before fiscal 2029, from any penalties collected for violations of the bill. The 
application of existing criminal penalty provisions to violations of the bill is not anticipated 
to materially affect State incarceration expenditures. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The bill likely affects recycling streams, which are often managed 
by local governments. This change means local revenues and expenditures are likely 
affected, although the overall impact on local jurisdictions depends largely on the content 
of the producer responsibility plans, which cannot be predicted. Local governments may 
benefit from the diversion of covered materials from landfills and an increase in recycling 
rates, which assists counties in meeting their mandatory recycling rates under MRA. 
 
For local governments that register as service providers – which must happen by 
January 1, 2029, and annually thereafter in order to be eligible for reimbursement – local 
revenues increase from reimbursements for covered services for covered materials 
(i.e., costs collect, transfer, transport, sort, process, recover, prepare, or otherwise manage 
covered materials that are listed under a producer responsibility plan). 
 
Local governments may further benefit from investments in capital improvements to 
improve reuse, composting, and recycling in the State. The bill specifies that funding that 
will be used for improving reuse, composing, and recycling must include investment in 
market development and existing and future reuse, including, among other things, 
(1) installing or upgrading equipment to improve the sorting of materials at existing sorting 
and processing facilities and (2) capital expenditures for new technology, equipment, and 
facilities, based on the results of the most recent statewide recycling needs assessment.

START OF PAGE 17
    
SB 901/ Page 17 
Similar to the impact described above at the State level, expenditures for local governments 
as consumers of covered materials may increase, likely not until fiscal 2028. 
 
The application of existing criminal penalty provisions to violations of the bill is not 
anticipated to materially affect local incarceration expenditures. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Although it is anticipated that the bill’s provisions relating to 
producers primarily affect larger businesses that meet the applicable minimum gross 
revenue and tonnage of covered materials (specified under the definition of “producer”), 
the bill results in significant additional operational responsibilities, and potentially 
significant costs, for affected producers that are small businesses to develop and implement 
producer responsibility plans for covered materials. 
 
The bill’s changes could incentivize the development of small businesses in the State that 
recycle or reuse covered materials or that supply raw materials used to manufacture 
covered materials. Similar to the impact described above at the local level, any small 
business that registers with MDE as a service provider benefits from the ability to be 
reimbursed to provide covered services for covered materials. 
 
Similar to the impact described above at the State and local levels, there could be an 
increase in costs for small businesses as consumers of covered materials. However, to the 
extent that the bill improves reuse, composting, and recycling in the State, small businesses 
consumers of covered materials benefit from having additional opportunities for managing 
the materials.
