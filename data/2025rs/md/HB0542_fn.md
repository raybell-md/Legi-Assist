powers when (1) participating in a joint investigation with officials from a State or local 
law enforcement unit; (2) rendering assistance to a police officer; (3) acting at the request 
of a local police officer or State Police officer; or (4) an emergency exists. 
 
Reporting and Investigating Abuse of Alleged Vulnerable Adults 
 
In general, each health practitioner, police officer, or human service worker who contacts, 
examines, attends, or treats an alleged vulnerable adult, and who has reason to believe that 
the alleged vulnerable adult has been subjected to abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or 
exploitation must (1) notify the local department of social services and (2) if acting as a 
staff member of a hospital or public health agency, immediately notify and give required 
information to the head of the institution (or a designee). Additionally, any individual other 
than a health practitioner, human service worker, or police officer who has reason to believe 
that an alleged vulnerable adult has been subjected to abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or 
exploitation may file an oral or written report of the suspected abuse, neglect, self-neglect, 
or exploitation with the local department. 
 
The local department of social services must begin a thorough investigation within 
five working days after the receipt of the report of suspected abuse, neglect, self-neglect, 
or exploitation or within 24 hours after the receipt of the report of suspected abuse, neglect, 
self-neglect, or exploitation if the report indicates that an emergency exists. 
 
On request of the local department, the local State’s Attorney or the appropriate law 
enforcement agency must assist in the investigation. As appropriate, specified entities 
providing services or care to the alleged vulnerable adult or whose information or expertise 
may be of assistance in assessing risk or planning services may assist in the investigation 
on the request by the local department. 
 
Based on the investigation, the local department must (1) render or assist a vulnerable adult 
to receive the appropriate services in the best interests of the vulnerable adult under the 
APS program; (2) as appropriate, involve the local office on aging; (3) report to the 
appropriate local law enforcement agency any incident of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of 
an alleged vulnerable adult where the possibility of a crime being committed against the 
alleged vulnerable adult is indicated by information provided in the initial report or by 
information obtained in the course of investigation; and (4) send to the local State’s 
Attorney and the appropriate local law enforcement agency a report of the investigation of 
any incident of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an alleged vulnerable adult, which was or 
should have been reported to the appropriate local law enforcement agency. 
 
Prohibition and Exemption of Specified Information Disclosure

recipient of social services, child welfare services, cash assistance, food stamps, or medical

assistance that is directly or indirectly derived from the records, investigations, or 
communications of the State, a county, or a municipal corporation or a unit of the State, a 
county, or a municipal corporation or that is acquired in the course of the performance of 
official duties. (The bill incorporates adult protective services.) Exempt from this 
prohibition is the disclosure of information: 
 
 
in accordance with a court order; 
 
to an officer or employee of any state or local government, the United States, or a 
fiduciary institution, if the officer or employee is entitled to the information in an 
official capacity and the disclosure is necessary to administer (1) public assistance, 
medical assistance, social services, or child welfare services programs (the bill adds 
adult protective services) or (2) voter registration; and 
 
to a fiduciary institution that reported suspected financial abuse or financial 
exploitation, if the fiduciary institution is authorized to request the information, as 
specified. 
 
A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a 
maximum penalty of 90 days’ imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. 
 
A fiduciary institution is required to disclose certain financial records to an APS program 
that is investigating suspected financial abuse or financial exploitation. In addition, an 
APS agency or a law enforcement agency may share specified information with a fiduciary 
institution that made a report of suspected financial abuse or financial exploitation.
