Background:  On September 24, 2024, the Attorney General, on behalf of the State and 
all its agencies, filed a lawsuit against the owners of the motor vessel Dali for causing the 
allision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024, which destroyed the bridge 
and resulted in the death of six men and injuries of two others. The full complaint can be 
found here. As detailed in the complaint, the resulting wreckage from the allision fell into 
the Patapsco River, blocking the Fort McHenry Channel and interrupting all commercial 
vessel traffic into or out of the Port of Baltimore.
