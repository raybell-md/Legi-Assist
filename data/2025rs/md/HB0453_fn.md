Anne Arundel County - Development Impact Fees 
 
 
This bill enables Anne Arundel County to grant additional exemptions from and credits 
against the development impact fee. Under current law, only the development by 
not-for-profit entities that have been in existence for at least three years is eligible for an 
exemption or credit. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None. 
  
Local Effect:  Potential decrease in Anne Arundel County revenues from the development 
impact fee to the extent that the county government grants additional exemptions or credits. 
County expenditures for capital improvement projects are not directly affected. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill authorizes Anne Arundel County to grant exemptions from or 
credits against the development impact fee for a construction or development project that: 
 
 
is a moderately priced dwelling unit; 
 
is an accessory dwelling unit; 
 
is workforce housing; or 
 
qualifies for impact fee credits for any conveyance of land or construction received 
and accepted by the county or the County Board of Education from a developer,

including the construction of a contract school by a developer or a developer’s agent 
under an agreement with the State Board of Education and the conveyance or 
construction meets the same needs as the development impact fee to provide 
expanded capacity beyond the county’s subdivision and development requirements. 
 
Current Law:  Anne Arundel County imposes a development impact fee on new 
construction in the county to finance the costs for public facilities required to accommodate 
the new construction or development. This authority was granted by the General Assembly 
in 1986 through Chapter 350.  
 
Development Impact Fees and Excise Taxes in Maryland 
 
Local governments must have authority from the General Assembly in order to impose a 
development impact fee or excise tax. Code home rule counties are authorized as a group 
to impose specified impact fees and excise taxes, and a number of other counties have 
specific authorizations from the General Assembly. Currently, 15 counties in Maryland 
impose development impact fees or excise taxes, with estimated revenue collections 
totaling $186.3 million in fiscal 2025. While authorized to impose a development excise 
tax, Dorchester County has suspended the collection of excise tax revenues since 
fiscal 2014. The suspension was most recently extended through June 30, 2025, by actions 
from the county council.  
 
The Appendix – Development Impact Fees and Excise Taxes provides information on 
the tax rates imposed by Maryland counties and the associated revenues generated in 
fiscal 2023 through 2025. The statutory authority for a county to impose a development 
impact fee or excise tax is provided in the Guide to Local Government Taxing Authority, 
which is available on the Department of Legislative Services website.  
 
Development Impact Fee 
 
A development impact fee is a regulatory measure designed to fund facilities specifically 
required by new development projects in order to mitigate the impact of such development 
on infrastructure or public facilities. However, there must be a reasonable connection 
between the amount of the impact fee imposed and the actual cost of providing facilities to 
the properties assessed. In order to justify the imposition of an impact fee, a jurisdiction 
must conduct a study that measures the effects that new development will have on public 
facilities. The amount of an impact fee is subject to judicial review. Moreover, the revenue 
from the fee must be dedicated to substantially benefit the assessed properties. Thus, a 
county cannot collect an impact fee in one geographic area and spend the funds in another 
area.

HB 453/ Page 3 
Development Excise Tax 
 
A development excise tax is another means of raising revenue from new development. 
Unlike a regulatory impact fee, the amount of an excise tax does not have to be closely 
related to the actual cost of providing public facilities to serve new development. In 
addition, excise tax revenues do not have to be spent to specifically benefit the properties 
that are taxed but may generally be spent throughout the county.  
 
Collection and Uses of Development Impact Fees and Excise Taxes 
 
The impact fee amounts and excise tax rates are generally established in the county 
implementing ordinance for the impact fee or excise tax or by county resolution. In some 
cases, limits on the fees or rates are set in the General Assembly authorization for the fee 
or tax. Different fees and rates often apply to different types of development and, in some 
cases, development in different areas of the county. Exemptions and/or waivers or deferrals 
are often available for certain types of development, such as affordable housing. A number 
of counties also allow certain conveyances or dedications of land or construction of public 
facilities by the developer to substitute for payment of the fee or tax.  
 
In counties that impose development impact fees and excise taxes, the charges are collected 
by the county and are often required to be paid before a building permit or zoning certificate 
is issued. Municipalities may, in some cases, assist counties in the collection of the charges 
within their jurisdictions. In a given county, other charges imposed on new development 
(while not accounted for here as development impact fees or excise taxes) may also be 
directed partially or wholly toward new or expanded facilities (e.g., water/sewer system 
development charges or connection charges).  
 
Public services funded by development impact fees and excise taxes include public school 
construction, libraries, community colleges, transportation, public safety, parks and 
recreation, and utilities. Statutory restrictions on allowable uses of the impact fee and 
excise tax revenue vary by jurisdiction. Use of the revenue for creation or expansion of 
public facilities rather than for maintenance or operations of existing facilities is often 
required. Some county ordinances also require that the additional or expanded facilities 
benefit the development from which the revenue was generated or benefit a defined district 
or area in which the development is located.  
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Anne Arundel County is projected to collect $20.7 million in 
development impact fees in fiscal 2024 and $24.6 million in fiscal 2025. The development 
impact fees are used for capital improvement projects for schools, transportation, and 
public safety. Under the bill, Anne Arundel County revenues from the development impact 
fee could decrease to the extent that the county government grants additional exemptions

HB 453/ Page 4 
or credits. The extent of any such revenue decrease will be dependent on the actions of the 
county council through the enactment of an ordinance.

Appendix – Development Impact Fees and Excise Taxes 
 
 
This appendix compiles information on (1) the development impact fees and excise taxes 
imposed by Maryland counties and (2) the revenues generated by the fees/taxes. 
Development impact fees and excise taxes enable local governments to collect revenue for 
new or expanded public facilities or services necessitated by new residential or commercial 
development, shifting the costs of financing the new or expanded facilities/services from 
existing taxpayers to those responsible for the development. 
 
The county development impact fees and excise taxes included in this appendix are those 
charges generally identified as development impact fees or excise taxes, or a variation of 
those terms (in some cases “surcharge” or “impact tax” is used). This appendix does not 
include all charges imposed on new development to generate revenue to cover costs of new 
or expanded public facilities/services, however. Some jurisdictions also impose water- and 
sewer-related charges (such as capital connection charges or system development charges), 
and/or mitigation payments based in the county’s adequate public facilities ordinance, that 
generate revenue for new or expanded public facilities/services. While not focused on in 
this appendix, a number of Maryland’s municipalities also impose impact fees or similar 
charges on new development to generate revenue for public facilities or services they 
provide. 
 
The first table below shows the counties’ fee amount or tax rate for a single-family 
detached home in each of fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025. 
 
The second table shows actual or projected/estimated revenues from counties’ 
development impact fees and excise taxes for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025. This table is 
based primarily on information provided by the counties in response to the Department of 
Legislative Services’ (DLS) and the Maryland Association of Counties’ FY 2025 Local 
Government Budget and Tax Rate Survey conducted during summer 2024, supplemented 
by DLS follow up with certain counties. The extent to which the revenue amounts are 
actual vs. projected/estimated varies. The fiscal 2023 amounts are actual revenue amounts, 
and the fiscal 2024 and 2025 amounts are projected/estimated revenues in most cases; in 
limited cases, some counties were able to provide actual fiscal 2024 revenue amounts.

1 Fees/rates listed are generally those applicable to single-family detached dwellings and are per dwelling unless otherwise indicated. 
2 Rates are for a 2,000-2,499 square foot residential unit. Residential rates vary by the square footage of a unit. 
3 Baltimore County Bill 45-24 established a $6.00 per square foot development impact fee for residential development effective August 25, 2024. 
4 The schools portion of the impact fee was increased from $0 to $3,000, making the total impact fee $3,533, effective September 1, 2023. 
5 The county development excise tax has been suspended since 2014. The suspension was most recently extended through June 30, 2025, by Bill No. 2024-6. See also § 144-36.1 of the county code. 
6 The rates shown reflect the public school and library impact fee total. 
7 The impact fee is increased from $6,000 to $10,000 – effective March 1, 2025 – pursuant to Bill No. 24-033. 
8 Fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 amounts represent the total of the roads tax amount ($1.60/sq. ft., 1.67/sq. ft., and 1.90/sq. ft, respectively) and the school surcharge amount ($6.25/sq. ft., $7.50/sq. ft, and 
$8.15/sq. ft, respectively). 
9 Amounts shown in the table represent the highest rates, that only apply in certain areas. Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 amounts represent $26,084 for schools in turnover impact areas and $30,190 for 
transportation in yellow and green policy areas. (In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the other transportation rates are $24,151 in orange policy areas and $9,663 in the red policy areas, and the other schools rate, in 
infill impact areas, is $25,004.) 
10 Amounts shown in the table represent the total of the school facilities and public safety/behavioral health amounts. Fiscal 2025 amount represents $20,500 for school facilities and $9,680 for public 
safety/behavioral health. A lower school facilities rate ($11,950 in fiscal 2025) applies inside the beltway and to certain development near mass transit and a lower public safety/behavioral health rate 
($3,229 in fiscal 2025) applies inside the Transportation Service Area 1 as defined in the Prince George’s County Approved General Plan and to certain development near mass transit. 
11 Impact fee rates for fiscal 2023 are for a dwelling of 1,200 to 2,399 square feet. Rates vary by the square footage of a unit. Beginning July 1, 2023, the county switched from the development impact fee 
to a building excise tax of $6,697 for single family residential units. 
12 A lower rate ($7,852 in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025) applies to development inside municipalities.

1 The county imposes a development impact surcharge on new nonresidential construction and a development impact fee on new residential construction; however, minimal revenues have been collected 
from the surcharge and fee to date and substantial revenues are not expected in fiscal 2025. 
2 The county development excise tax has been suspended since 2014. The suspension was most recently extended through June 30, 2025, by Bill No. 2024-6. See also § 144-36.1 of the county code.
