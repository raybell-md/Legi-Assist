2025 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Third Reader - Revised 
House Bill 1035 
(The Speaker and Delegate Wilson) 
Economic Matters 
 
 
Electricity and Gas - Emissions Reductions, Rate Regulation, Cost Recovery, 
Infrastructure, Planning, Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, and Energy 
Assistance Programs (Next Generation Energy Act) 
 
 
This bill establishes or modifies various provisions of law affecting electricity generation, 
utility cost recovery, and large customer interconnections, among other related changes. 
The bill also establishes a process to provide two residential electric customer bill credits 
in fiscal 2026. The bill takes effect June 1, 2025. Provisions establishing an expedited 
approval process for specified energy generation resources terminate June 30, 2030. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  No effect in FY 2025. Special fund expenditures for the administrative costs 
of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and the Office of People’s Counsel (OPC) 
increase by at least $2.9 million annually beginning in FY 2026; special fund revenues 
increase correspondingly from assessments on public service companies. Special fund 
expenditures for PSC further increase by $200 million in FY 2026, and potentially in 
future years, to provide residential electric customer bill credits. The FY 2026 budget as 
passed by the General Assembly authorizes the Governor to transfer up to $200 million 
from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) to PSC in FY 2026 for that purpose, 
contingent on enactment of this bill or its cross file. General/special fund expenditures for 
the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) increase by $0.8 million in FY 2026 and by 
at least $1.2 million annually thereafter. Assumptions and other effects are discussed 
below.

HB 1035/ Page 4 
 
EmPOWER Maryland Program 
 
When calculating the achievement of GHG emissions reduction targets under the 
EmPOWER Maryland Program, DHCD may procure or provide savings that are achieved 
through all funding sources, to the extent that the savings from those funding sources are 
achieved (1) in a manner consistent with requirements of the U.S. Department of Energy 
or (2) in a manner otherwise consistent with the energy savings requirements applicable to 
those funding sources. 
 
Investor-owned Utilities Internal versus Contractual Labor Justification 
 
In a base rate proceeding to set just and reasonable rates, each investor-owned gas company 
and investor-owned electric company must demonstrate to PSC the reasonableness of the 
use of internal labor in comparison to contractual labor. To do so, the company must 
provide to PSC, at a minimum: 
 
 
a comparison of the costs of internal labor and contractual labor; 
 
a demonstration of the reasonableness of the decision to use contractual labor; 
 
a justification for the use of contractual labor when used instead of internal labor, 
including a cost-based rationale; and 
 
any other information that PSC requires. 
 
Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Surcharge 
 
It is the intent of the General Assembly that the purpose of the STRIDE surcharge process 
is to allow for the appropriate acceleration of gas infrastructure improvements in the State, 
when necessary to ensure safety and improve reliability and consistent with State policy. 
(Italics indicates change from current law.) 
 
In addition to other existing requirements, a plan filed by a gas company with PSC must 
include: 
 
 
a description of each eligible infrastructure replacement project, including the 
project’s expected useful life; 
 
a demonstration that the gas company has selected and given priority to projects 
based on risk to the public and cost-effectiveness; 
 
an analysis that compares the costs of proposed replacement projects with 
alternatives to replacement, including leak detection and repair; and 
 
a plan, subject to specified requirements, for notifying customers affected by 
proposed projects at least six months in advance of construction. 
 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 1035/ Page 5 
The plan must be filed separately from a base rate proceeding. 
 
For a gas company to recover costs associated with eligible infrastructure replacement 
projects, a plan must demonstrate customer benefits and that the gas company has 
(1) analyzed available cost-effective options to defer, reduce, or remove the need to 
replace, construct, or upgrade components of the company’s distribution infrastructure and 
(2) met any other requirements established by PSC, as specified. 
 
In addition to other current criteria, PSC may approve a gas company’s plan if it finds that 
the investments and estimated costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects are 
required to improve the safety of the gas system after consideration of alternatives to 
replacement. 
 
PSC may authorize a gas company to use a mechanism to promptly recover reasonable and 
prudent costs of investments for eligible infrastructure replacement projects that  
(1) are part of an approved plan or implemented as otherwise authorized under the STRIDE 
surcharge process and (2) accelerate gas infrastructure improvements in the State. 
 
Specific Rate Schedules for Large Load Customers 
 
 
Timing and Applicability 
 
It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State 
should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to 
the electric system serving the State. “Large load customer” means a commercial or 
industrial customer for retail electric service that has or is projected to have an aggregate 
monthly demand of at least 100 megawatts and a load factor of over 80%. 
 
By September 1, 2026, each investor-owned electric company and each electric 
cooperative must submit to PSC for approval a specific rate schedule for large load 
customers that accomplishes the above-described intent of the General Assembly. Each 
municipal electric utility that receives an application for retail electric service from a large 
load customer must also submit a specific rate schedule for approval. 
 
Service under a specific rate schedule must be available to large load customers that will 
use, within the initial contract term, either (1) a monthly maximum demand of more than 
100 megawatts at a single location or (2) an aggregated contract capacity in the electric 
company’s service territory of more than 100 megawatts. 
 
Generally, large load customers that qualify for the specific rate schedule after the effective 
date of the schedule must take service under that schedule and may not be allowed to take 
service under any other existing schedule. However, a specific rate schedule does not apply 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 1035/ Page 6 
to an existing large load customer that has signed a service agreement before the effective 
date of the schedule in limited specified circumstances. 
 
Before signing a contract for service under the schedule, a large load customer must 
(1) submit a request for a load study to determine the necessary contract capacity for the 
customer and pay any applicable fees associated with the study; (2) designate a specific 
site where the customer’s project will be constructed and served by the electric company 
(the customer must own or have exclusive right to use the land); and (3) meet any other 
requirements specified under the rate schedule. 
 
 
Requirements for Approval by the Public Service Commission 
 
In making a determination on whether to approve a specific rate schedule for large load 
customers, PSC must consider whether the rate schedule: 
 
 
requires a large load customer to cover the just and reasonable costs associated with 
any electric transmission or distribution system buildout required to (1) interconnect 
the customer to the electric system serving the State or (2) serve the customer; 
 
protects residential retail electric customers from the financial risks associated with 
large load customers through the use of (1) load ramp periods; (2) minimum billing 
demand for electric distribution and transmission service, as specified; 
(3) long-term contractual commitments and exit fees; (4) guarantee or collateral 
requirements; and (5) penalties and reimbursement requirements; and 
 
sufficiently ensures that the allocation of costs to large load customers under the 
schedule does not result in other customers unreasonably subsidizing the costs of 
large load customers. 
 
 
Regulations 
 
By June 1, 2026, PSC must adopt regulations to carry out the above requirements, which 
must (1) establish minimum notice requirements and deadlines related to load study 
requests and contract terminations and adjustments; (2) specify common forms of 
acceptable collateral to satisfy the requirements described above, if considered necessary 
by PSC; and (3) establish deadlines related to completion of load studies and payment of 
fees. 
 
Multi-year Rate Plan Requirements 
 
Unless otherwise authorized by law, PSC may approve the use of a multi-year rate plan for 
distribution base rates for a gas, electric, or combination gas and electric company only if 
the plan: 
 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 1035/ Page 7 
 
demonstrates the customer benefits of the investment; and  
 
does not allow for the company to file for reconciliation of cost or revenue variances 
of the approved revenue component used by PSC to establish just and reasonable 
rates. 
 
A gas, electric, or combination gas and electric company that files or has filed an 
application for a multi-year rate plan may not subsequently file for reconciliation of cost 
or revenue variances of the approved revenue component used by PSC to establish the 
multi-year rates unless the filing for reconciliation was made on or before January 1, 2025. 
 
Existing provisions authorizing PSC to regulate the regulated services of an electric 
company through alternative forms of regulation are subject to these requirements. 
 
Recovery of Planned Gas Infrastructure Investments 
 
An investor-owned gas company may recover reasonable and prudent costs associated with 
a planned gas infrastructure investment if the company demonstrates at a rate setting 
proceeding: 
 
 
the customer benefits of the investment; 
 
that the company analyzed cost-effective options available to defer, reduce, or 
eliminate the need to replace, upgrade, or construct new components, including an 
analysis of (1) for new investments unrelated to safety, nonpipeline alternatives, as 
defined, and (2) leak detection and repair; and 
 
the estimated risk reduction associated with a safety-related investment, if 
applicable. 
 
Nothing in this provision may be construed to restrict an investor-owned gas company’s 
ability to make improvements to its gas system to ensure the safe and reliable operation of 
the system. 
 
Prohibited Cost Recovery through Rates 
 
An investor-owned gas, electric, or combination gas and electric company may not recover 
through rates any cost associated with: 
 
 
membership, dues, sponsorships, or contributions to an industry trade association, 
group, or related entity exempt from taxation under § 501(c)(6) of the Internal 
Revenue Code; or 
 
the acquisition, use, or allocation of costs associated with a private plane that is 
owned or leased by the company or its holding company.

HB 1035/ Page 8 
Applicability of Certain Contracts for Underground Utility Infrastructure Work 
 
The bill clarifies an existing requirement for an investor-owned gas, electric, or 
combination gas and electric company to require contractors and subcontractors to pay 
their employees at least the applicable prevailing wage rate in certain circumstances. More 
specifically, a contract entered into after March 1, 2024, by a company for specified 
underground utility work and related traffic control activities includes a contract that has 
been executed, amended, or altered after that date. 
 
Policy of the State to Encourage Nuclear Power 
 
The General Assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of the State to encourage the 
development of clean, carbon-free nuclear power, including development through 
innovative designs. 
 
Nuclear Energy Generation Stations – Regional Planning and Cost Sharing 
 
MEA, in coordination with PSC and DNR, must pursue (1) cost-sharing agreements with 
neighboring states in the PJM Interconnection (PJM) region to mitigate the risks of 
developing new nuclear energy generating stations and (2) agreements with 
federal agencies regarding the siting of small modular reactors on federal land or on or near 
federal facilities. 
 
By December 1, 2026, MEA must report to the General Assembly on the status of the 
efforts made in pursuing the above agreements, including an assessment of any 
opportunities to participate with other states, federal agencies, and public or private 
partners in a multistate procurement of new nuclear energy technology. MEA must also 
report on an evaluation and status of the nuclear energy procurement process established 
under the bill (described below). 
 
Distribution Connected Energy Storage Devices 
 
The General Assembly finds and declares that the State has a goal of reaching 
150 megawatts of distribution-connected front-of-the-meter energy storage devices. PSC 
must notify each investor-owned electric company of its proportion of the goal by 
July 1, 2025, and by July 1, 2026, based on the company’s service load or other criteria 
established by PSC. 
 
Subject to specified requirements, the bill establishes two rounds of applications and 
related approval and construction timelines. For the first round, by November 1, 2025, PSC 
must require each investor-owned electric company to submit a plan to achieve up to 
one-third of its share of the overall goal. By May 1, 2026, PSC must evaluate each plan, 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 1035/ Page 9 
accept public comments, and issue an order approving, modifying, or rejecting the plan. 
The energy storage devices that are constructed or procured under the plan must be 
operational by November 1, 2027. The deadlines for the second round, which covers the 
remaining balance of the electric company’s share of the overall goal, are one year later. 
PSC may extend a deadline for good cause. 
 
PSC must require each plan to demonstrate that the construction or procurement of each 
energy storage device (1) is cost-effective in consideration of a cost-benefit analysis, 
including a demonstration of specified avoided costs and emissions; (2) can be completed 
within 18 months after the plan is approved; and (3) complies with any other factors 
determined by PSC. Each project must include a proposed decommissioning plan, which 
may be subsequently updated, as specified. The bill also establishes various wage and labor 
requirements for third parties and electric companies that construct and/or own energy 
storage devices under the above provisions. 
 
Behind-the-meter Co-location – Authorization to Apply Specified Costs 
 
In specified co-location arrangements between a commercial or industrial customer and a 
generating station, PSC may apply: 
 
 
any direct or indirect costs, fees, and obligations that are normally applied to retail 
electric customers in the service territory in which the commercial or industrial 
customer or generating station is located or interconnected, if PSC determines that 
they should be attributable to the customer and generating station; and 
 
any avoided wholesale costs that PSC determines have been or may be shifted 
inappropriately to other retail electric customers as a result of the provision of the 
direct supply of electricity through the co-location arrangement, including costs 
associated with transmission, energy, capacity, and ancillary services. 
 
Generally, the provision applies only to those entities when they enter into a contract for 
the provision of electricity in a way that bypasses (1) interconnection of the load with the 
electric transmission and distribution systems or (2) the distribution services of an electric 
company. However, the provision does not apply to the use of electricity from an on-site 
generating station that has been approved under the CPCN exemption process. 
 
The bill makes related changes to the definitions of electric company and electricity 
supplier to specify that a person who provides electricity to a commercial or industrial 
customer in accordance with a co-location arrangement described above is an electricity 
supplier.

HB 1035/ Page 10 
Dispatchable Energy Generation and Large Capacity Energy Resources 
 
 
Generally 
 
The bill establishes a solicitation, evaluation, and approval process for a minimum of 
3,109 megawatts of dispatchable energy generation and large capacity resources, 
beginning no later than October 1, 2025. Generally, PSC may approve up to 10 projects. 
An approved project is eligible to undergo an expedited CPCN process established under 
the bill through June 30, 2030. Generally, PSC may not approve or develop a financial 
commitment for the costs related to the construction or operation of a project approved 
under the procurement process, although an approved project may participate in other 
processes under which ratepayer funds are awarded to dispatchable energy generation or 
large capacity energy projects. 
 
“Dispatchable energy generation” means a generating station or energy storage device, as 
defined in current law, with (1) an effective load carrying capability of at least 65%, as 
determined by PJM’s most recent Effective Load Carrying Capability Class Ratings and 
(2) a lower GHG emissions profile than coal or oil energy generating stations. “Effective 
load carrying capability” means the expected capacity contribution of an energy resource 
during PJM’s operating hours when there is high electricity demand and low resource 
output. “Large capacity energy resource” means a 20 megawatt or larger generating station 
or energy storage device that, by January 1, 2025, had applied to or been approved by PJM 
for interconnection. 
 
 
Determination of Capacities 
 
The combined total capacity of dispatchable energy generation projects and large capacity 
energy resource projects approved by PSC must be more than the combined summer peak 
capacity profile of coal and oil energy generating stations in the State as outlined under 
Table 9 of PSC’s Ten-Year Plan (2024-2033) of Electric Companies in Maryland 
(i.e., 3,109 megawatts). However, the combined total capacity of natural gas dispatchable 
energy generation projects and large capacity energy resource projects approved by PSC 
may not exceed that amount. 
 
 
Procurement Timelines 
 
By October 1, 2025, PSC must issue one or more solicitations for proposals for the 
construction or expansion of dispatchable energy generation and large capacity energy 
resources. PSC must set the closing date for the solicitation period to be no sooner than 
30 days after issuing the request for proposals. PSC may provide for an additional 
solicitation period if the 3,109-megawatt capacity minimum has not been met during the 
initial solicitation period. Within 45 days after the closing date, the Power Plant Research 
Program (PPRP) in DNR must recommend proposals, based on specified criteria, to be 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
HB 1035/ Page 11 
authorized to utilize the expedited CPCN process. Generally, after consideration of PPRP’s 
recommendations, subject to specified evaluation criteria, PSC must approve, conditionally 
approve, or deny a proposal; however, PSC may grant an extension for good cause. 
 
 
Project Specifications 
 
PSC must include specifications in the solicitations that require each proposal for a 
dispatchable energy generation project and large capacity energy resource project to: 
 
 
if the project is a natural gas energy generating station, ensure that the project can 
be converted to use only hydrogen or a zero-emissions biofuel as the energy source 
when PSC determines that the conversion is feasible (an approved operational 
project must submit a report to PSC every five years regarding the feasibility of 
conversion); 
 
include a detailed description of the timeline for construction of the project and the 
location of the project site, as specified; 
 
if applicable, include a description of (1) the type and amount of co-located energy 
generation from Tier 1 renewable sources, as defined in current law, that would be 
used with the project; (2) the amount of co-located energy storage that would be 
used with the project; (3) the use of carbon capture or sequestration technology to 
mitigate GHG emissions from the project; and (4) the amount of hydrogen or 
zero-emissions biofuels that the project will mix with natural gas for energy 
generation; and 
 
state the emissions intensity of the generation output over the life of the project. 
 
 
Evaluation and Approval 
 
Generally, PSC may approve up to 10 proposals to be eligible to undergo the expedited 
CPCN process. PSC may approve more than 10 proposals if it has sufficient resources to 
complete that number of expedited CPCN application reviews and the number of expedited 
reviews is in the public interest. If 10 or fewer projects respond to a solicitation, PSC must 
approve all projects that apply, subject to the 3,109-megawatt capacity limit for natural gas 
projects. 
 
Generally, 
PSC 
must 
approve 
4 
non-emissions-emitting 
projects 
to 
every 
1 emissions-emitting project (transmission energy storage is considered non-emitting). 
PSC may waive that requirement if insufficient applications are received. 
 
PSC must determine which proposals to approve based on the project specifications 
described above and, if PSC receives more than 10 proposals or determines that more than 
10 proposals may be approved, must base the approvals on (1) which projects will provide 
the highest capacity value to the State; (2) the timeliness of a project to begin construction; 

END OF PAGE 11

START OF PAGE 12
    
HB 1035/ Page 12 
(3) the timeliness of a project to begin operation; and (4) which projects have the lowest 
emissions intensity. PSC may contract for the services of independent consultants and 
experts in evaluating and comparing proposals. PSC must determine when the proceedings 
for an expedited CPCN will begin for a proposal approved under the above process. 
 
An approval or conditional approval of a project under the above process does not 
guarantee that the project will be issued a CPCN – expedited or otherwise. A proposal that 
is not approved to be eligible to undergo an expedited CPCN process may still apply for a 
standard CPCN. 
 
 
Expedited Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in § 7-207 of the Public Utilities Article, a CPCN for 
the construction of a generating station that is part of a proposal approved by PSC through 
the above process (a “qualifying project”) must be issued in accordance with the 
requirements for an expedited CPCN described below. A person may not construct a 
qualifying project without a CPCN – including an energy storage device that is part of an 
approved proposal. 
 
For a qualifying project, PSC must expedite all proceedings for CPCN review and approval 
and, except in limited circumstances, take final action within 295 days after the application 
is determined to be complete by PPRP. In order to meet the required timelines, PSC may 
also review and determine whether to approve decommissioning plans for a qualifying 
project after a CPCN has been issued. The bill specifies other minor process-related 
requirements. PSC may prioritize the review of qualifying projects over other CPCN 
applications, and, in doing so, may extend standard CPCN review timelines. 
 
Generally, the timelines associated with the normal pre-application requirements, 
including those under COMAR 20.79.01.04 and COMAR 20.79.01.05, must be shortened 
to 45 days. However, if the proposed location of the project is in an overburdened or 
underserved community, the COMAR timelines remain at 90 days. 
 
An expedited CPCN bestows the same rights as a standard CPCN. 
 
These provisions terminate June 30, 2030. 
 
Nuclear Energy Procurement 
 
The bill establishes a minimum of three rounds of applications and related requirements 
for PSC approval of one or more proposed nuclear energy generation projects funded 
through electric distribution rates.

HB 1035/ Page 13 
 
Applications 
 
After the effective date of PSC regulations implementing the provisions described below, 
a person may submit an application to PSC for approval of a proposed nuclear energy 
generation project, subject to specified requirements. PSC must adopt regulations, as 
specified, by July 1, 2027. 
 
On receipt of an application, PSC must (1) open an application period of at least 90 days 
where other interested persons may submit applications for approval of a proposed nuclear 
energy generation project and (2) provide notice that PSC is accepting applications. PSC 
must provide at least two additional application periods before January 1, 2031, and may 
provide additional application periods. Generally, PSC must approve, conditionally 
approve, or deny an application within one year of the close of the application period. PSC 
may extend that time period for good cause. 
 
The bill specifies what an application must include, such as (1) a detailed description and 
financial analysis; (2) a cost-benefit analysis, as specified, including an analysis of 
ratepayer and long-term energy market impacts; (3) a proposed long-term pricing schedule; 
(4) a decommissioning and waste storage plan; (5) a commitment to abide by a community 
benefit agreement, as further specified; (6) a description of the applicant’s plan for 
engaging small businesses; and (7) if applicable, a statement that includes information on 
minority investors interviewed and whether they have invested in the project. 
 
An applicant seeking investors must make serious, good-faith efforts to solicit and 
interview a reasonable number of minority investors and take other related actions. The 
Governor’s Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs (GOSBA), in 
consultation with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), must provide assistance to 
potential applications to satisfy the requirements. 
 
 
Evaluation and Approval 
 
The bill specifies the criteria that PSC must use to evaluate and compare applications, such 
as (1) the lowest cost impact on ratepayers and potential changes in related electricity 
market prices; (2) the extent to which the cost-benefit analysis demonstrates positive net 
economic, environmental, and health benefits to the State; (3) the extent to which the plan 
for engaging small businesses meets the State’s goal for small business contracting;  
(4) the extent to which the applicant’s plan provides for various specified labor 
considerations; and (5) the extent to which the project would require transmission or 
distribution infrastructure improvements in the State. 
 
Subject to specified processes and requirements, including that PSC must keep any 
determined amounts confidential, PSC may not approve an application unless: 

END OF PAGE 13

START OF PAGE 14
    
HB 1035/ Page 14 
 
the project is connected to the electric system serving the State; 
 
over the duration of the proposed long-term pricing schedule, projected net rate 
impacts for residential and nonresidential customers do not exceed amounts 
determined by PSC; and 
 
the price specified in the proposed long-term pricing schedule does not exceed an 
amount determined by PSC. 
 
Additionally, PSC may not issue an order to facilitate the financing of a nuclear energy 
generation project unless the project is subject to a community benefit agreement, which 
has various specified requirements. 
 
A PSC order approving a proposed project must (1) specify the long-term pricing schedule 
and its duration, up to 30 years; (2) provide that a payment may not be made under a 
long-term pricing schedule until electricity supply is generated from the project;  
(3) provide that ratepayers and the State must be held harmless for any cost overruns 
associated with the system; and (4) require that any debt issued in connection with the 
project include language specifying that the debt instrument does not establish a debt, an 
obligation, or a liability of the State. An order approving a project vests the owner with the 
right to receive payments according to the terms in the order. The long-term pricing 
schedule must be based only on any new generation proposed in the application, including 
new generation at an existing nuclear energy generating station. 
 
The findings and evidence relied on by the General Assembly for the continuation of the 
State’s Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) Program are incorporated into the bill. To the 
extent practicable and authorized by the U.S. Constitution, an applicant approved for a 
nuclear energy generation project must comply with the State’s MBE Program. Within 
six months after the issuance of a PSC order approving a project, GOSBA, in consultation 
with OAG and the applicant, must establish a clear plan for setting reasonable and 
appropriate MBE goals, as specified. 
 
 
Cost Recovery 
 
PSC must adopt regulations that: 
 
 
establish the nuclear energy long-term pricing purchase obligation sufficiently in 
advance to allow an electric company to reflect nuclear energy long-term pricing 
costs as a nonbypassable surcharge that is added to the electric company’s base 
distribution rate on customer bills; 
 
define rules that facilitate and ensure the secure and transparent transfer of revenues 
and long-term pricing payments among parties; 

END OF PAGE 14

START OF PAGE 15
    
HB 1035/ Page 15 
 
define the terms and procedures of the nuclear energy long-term pricing schedule 
obligations, as specified, by establishing a formula and process to adjust the value 
of the schedule every two years and a per-megawatt-hour cap; 
 
require PSC to establish an escrow account; and 
 
to meet the total statewide long-term pricing purchase obligation for all approved 
applications, require PSC to annually establish each electric company’s 
zero-emission credit (ZEC) purchase obligation, based on specified electricity sales 
data and each electric company’s proportional share of statewide electricity load. 
 
A ZEC is defined as the difference between the price that a nuclear energy generating 
station with a long-term pricing schedule approved in a PSC order under the bill may 
receive on the wholesale market and the cost of constructing the nuclear energy generating 
station. 
 
Each electric company must procure the required quantity of ZECs from the escrow 
account to meet its obligations. The bill also establishes a process to refund or credit 
customers in the event of overpayments due to insufficient ZECs being available. 
 
A debt, an obligation, or a liability of a nuclear energy generation project or of an owner 
or operator of a nuclear energy generation project may not be considered a debt, an 
obligation, or a liability of the State. 
 
 
Status Update 
 
By January 15, 2026, PSC must report to the General Assembly on the status of developing 
the regulations for the establishment and purchase of ZECs and whether any legislative 
action is necessary to implement the above provisions. 
 
Transmission Energy Storage Devices 
 
PSC must, by regulation or order, establish a competitive process for the procurement of 
projects for the construction and deployment of up to 1,600 megawatts of 
front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage devices in the State. PSC may end the 
process without selecting a proposal if PSC makes specified findings. 
 
Subject to specified requirements, including a public hearing process, the bill establishes 
two rounds of applications and related approval and construction timelines for up to 
800 megawatts of front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage capacity each. For the 
first round, PSC must issue the procurement solicitation by January 1, 2026, and issue 
one or more orders to select a proposal or proposals for development by October 1, 2026. 
The deadlines for the second round are one year later. The bill specifies various 

END OF PAGE 15

START OF PAGE 16
    
HB 1035/ Page 16 
requirements for the solicitation and selection. Generally, the energy storage devices must 
be operational within 24 months after selection. 
 
PSC must include specifications in the procurement solicitation that require each proposal 
to (1) include a proposed pricing schedule, as specified; (2) include a cost-benefit analysis, 
as specified; (3) ensure that the owner or operator of the project can export the electricity 
for sale on the wholesale market and bid into the PJM capacity market; (4) ensure that the 
energy storage devices can deliver their effective nameplate capacity, as further specified; 
(5) incorporate a community benefit agreement; (6) attest to compliance with specified 
labor laws; and (7) ensure a competitive bidding process. The energy storage devices may 
be paired with Tier 1 or Tier 2 renewable sources. 
 
The bill specifies actions PSC must and may take in selecting a proposal. For example, 
PSC must specify (1) a 15-year pricing schedule that uses a monthly fixed price for each 
megawatt that represents the anticipated wholesale value of capacity for the energy storage 
device and other specified benefits and (2) various requirements and processes to facilitate 
energy storage project funding and electric company cost recovery. Projects are funded 
through the purchase of credits by electricity suppliers, and electric companies can recover 
costs through a nonbypassable surcharge. PSC must also consider other nonprice factors to 
ensure project deliverability after the award date, as specified. Each project must include a 
proposed decommissioning plan, which may be subsequently updated, as specified. 
 
An order selecting a proposal bestows the same rights as would otherwise be granted 
through a CPCN. Any transmission energy storage device built in accordance with these 
provisions must count toward the energy storage device goals for distribution-connected 
energy storage devices described above. 
 
Legislative Fast Track Procurements 
 
PSC, OPC, MEA, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), and DNR are 
authorized to issue competitive sealed bids higher than their designated small procurement 
delegation authorities (currently $100,000) only for the procurement of consultants that  
(1) are legislatively mandated with specific timeframes established in law and  
(2) will address issues related only to climate change, the environment, energy, and  
GHG emissions. Before awarding a procurement contract under this authority, the 
procurement officer must obtain the approval of the head of the unit and the Chief 
Procurement Officer (CPO) or the CPO’s designee. The CPO or designee must approve 
the procurement contract if it complies with the above requirements. If the CPO or designee 
does not approve the procurement contract within five business days after receiving the 
contract, the contract must be considered approved.

Ratepayer Credit from Alternative Compliance Payments 
 
ACP revenue collected under the State RPS, which accrues to SEIF, may be used to provide 
grants to electric companies to be refunded or credited to each residential distribution 
customer based on the customer’s consumption of electricity supply that is subject to the 
RPS. The refunded or credited amounts must be identified on customer bills as a line item 
and labeled a “legislative energy relief refund.” An electric company awarded a grant for 
this purpose may not retain any of the grant funds to cover overhead expenses and must 
provide all of the grant funds to residential distribution customers. PSC must direct and 
oversee the process. 
 
Beginning in tax year 2025, to the extent that a legislative energy relief refund is included 
in federal adjusted gross income, the amount is subtracted to determine Maryland adjusted 
gross income (i.e., the credit is not considered taxable income for Maryland income tax 
purposes in 2025 or future years). 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, from ACPs paid into SEIF, a portion must be 
used to provide grant awards to electric companies, including electric cooperatives and 
municipal electric utilities, to be refunded or credited to residential distribution customers 
for electric service in fiscal 2026. The Governor may transfer by budget amendment the 
funds to PSC to be awarded to the electric companies. The funds must be distributed to 
residential electric distribution customers two times in fiscal 2026:  half during a peak 
summer month and the other half during a peak winter month. The distribution must also 
be in accordance with the SEIF provisions described above. 
 
Removal of Waste-to-energy and Refuse-derived Fuel from Renewable Energy Portfolio 
Standard 
 
Waste-to-energy and refuse-derived fuel are removed from eligibility for inclusion in the 
State RPS. The provision generally applies to all RPS compliance years starting on or after 
January 1, 2025, except for a facility owned by a public instrumentality of the State (in this 
case, Montgomery County), which applies beginning July 1, 2026. 
 
Support for Calvert Cliffs License 
 
The General Assembly supports the extension or renewal of the Federal Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission license for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant’s nuclear 
reactors in the years 2034 and 2036.

Department of Human Services Report on Energy Assistance Program Consolidation 
 
By January 1, 2026, DHS must report to the Governor and the General Assembly on any 
legislative or regulatory changes necessary to implement the recommendation to combine 
all energy assistance programs operated by the State into one program, as discussed in the 
Department of Legislative Services (DLS) Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability’s February 2025 Evaluation of the Office of Home Energy Programs. 
 
Current Law/Background: 
 
Department of Housing and Community Development Energy Programs 
 
Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Projects in Multifamily Residential 
Buildings 
 
CSNA required the Community Development Administration in DHCD to develop and 
implement a program to provide grants for energy conservation projects and projects to 
install renewable energy generating stations in covered buildings that house primarily 
low- to moderate-income households. “Covered building” means a commercial or 
multifamily residential building in the State or a building that is owned by the State and 
has a gross floor area of 35,000 square feet or more, excluding the garage area. There are 
certain exclusions, such as a designated historic property. Statute also provides for what 
constitutes an energy conservation project, with different requirements for residential and 
commercial buildings. Examples include caulking or weather stripping, insulation, storm 
windows or doors, and furnace efficiency modifications. 
 
The Governor must include in the annual budget bill an appropriation of $5.0 million in 
fiscal 2024 through 2026 for the purpose of providing the grants; the program is permanent, 
despite the cessation of mandated funding. 
 
DHCD has implemented the CSNA grant program as the GHG Reduction Program. The 
department advises that many covered buildings are subsidized properties, such as 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties, that have strict financial guidelines that 
prevent them from accepting grants. The ability to provide both grants and loans makes the 
GHG Reduction Program accessible to all eligible buildings. 
 
 
EmPOWER Maryland Program 
 
As part of the EmPOWER Maryland Program, beginning January 1, 2025, and by 
January 1 every three years thereafter starting in 2027, DHCD must procure or provide to 
low-income individuals energy efficiency and conservation programs and services, 
demand response programs and services, and beneficial electrification programs and 

END OF PAGE 18

START OF PAGE 19
    
HB 1035/ Page 19 
services that are on a trajectory to achieve GHG reductions of at least 0.9% of a 
2016 baseline after 2027, determined as specified. The requirement applies to the 
2025-2033 time period. The reductions count toward the overall GHG emissions reduction 
targets under the EmPOWER Maryland Program. 
 
DHCD advises that changes in eligible funding sources under Chapter 539 of 2024 
preclude about half of its available funding (a mixture of federal and State funds) from 
counting toward its EmPOWER targets. These funding sources were previously eligible 
(under Chapter 572 of 2023) and are incorporated into DHCD’s current EmPOWER plans. 
Absent the bill, additional EmPOWER surcharge revenues are required to provide the 
funding needed to meet the department’s EmPOWER targets 
 
Public Service Company Rates, Cost Recovery, and Operations 
 
 
Just and Reasonable Rates 
 
A public service company must charge just and reasonable rates for the regulated services 
that it renders. Generally, PSC has the power to set a just and reasonable rate of a public 
service company, as a maximum rate, minimum rate, or both. A “just and reasonable rate” 
means a rate that: 
 
 
does not violate any provision of the Public Utilities Article; 
 
fully considers and is consistent with the public good; and 
 
except for rates of a common carrier, will result in an operating income to the public 
service company that yields, after reasonable deduction for depreciation and other 
necessary and proper expenses and reserves, a reasonable return on the fair value of 
the public service company’s property used and useful in providing service to the 
public. 
 
At any time, PSC may investigate and determine the fair value of the property of a public 
service company used and useful in providing service to the public. 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, PSC may regulate the regulated services of an 
electric company through alternative forms of regulation. PSC may adopt an alternative 
form of regulation if it finds, after notice and hearing, that the alternative form of regulation 
(1) protects consumers; (2) ensures the quality, availability, and reliability of regulated 
electric services; and (3) is in the interest of the public, including shareholders of the 
electric company. Alternative forms of regulation may include price regulation, revenue 
regulation, ranges of authorized return, rate of return, categories of services, or price 
indexing.

Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Surcharge 
 
 
Overview and Purpose:  Chapter 161 of 2013 established an application and review 
process for gas infrastructure replacement plans with an associated monthly surcharge on 
customer bills (typically known as the “STRIDE” surcharge). The Act established the 
intent of the General Assembly that the purpose of the STRIDE surcharge process is to 
accelerate gas infrastructure improvements in the State by establishing a mechanism for 
gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of investments in eligible 
infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate proceedings. To that end, the 
surcharge is collected at the same time as the eligible infrastructure expenditures occur, as 
opposed to subsequent to the expenditures as authorized in a base rate proceeding. 
 
Subject to PSC review and approval, the fixed annual surcharge may not exceed  
$2 per month for each residential natural gas customer. The fixed annual surcharge for 
nonresidential customers may not be less than the fixed annual surcharge for residential 
customers but also must be capped. To create a surcharge cap for all customer classes, costs 
must be allocated between residential and nonresidential customers consistent with the 
proportions of total distribution revenues that those classes bear, as determined in the gas 
company’s most recent base rate filing. 
 
All three of Maryland’s major gas companies – BGE, Washington Gas, and Columbia Gas 
– have filed with PSC and received approval for gas infrastructure replacement plans since 
the surcharge was created. However, only Washington Gas and Elkton Gas have active 
STRIDE plans. As of 2024, BGE conducts its infrastructure replacement work under its 
multi-year rate plan. 
 
 
Eligible Infrastructure, Company Plans, Approval Criteria:  “Eligible infrastructure 
replacement” is defined as the replacement or improvement in the existing infrastructure 
of a gas company that is (1) made on or after June 1, 2013; (2) designed to improve public 
safety or infrastructure reliability; (3) does not increase the revenue of a gas company by 
connecting an improvement directly to new natural gas customers; (4) reduces or has the 
potential to reduce GHG emissions through a reduction in natural gas system leaks; and  
(5) is not included in the current rate base of the gas company as determined by the gas 
company’s most recent base rate proceeding. 
 
A plan for an eligible infrastructure replacement project must include (1) a timeline for 
completion of each eligible project; (2) the estimated cost of each project; (3) a description 
of customer benefits under the plan; and (4) any other information PSC considers necessary 
to evaluate the plan. 
 
PSC must take final action to approve or deny a plan within 180 days after a gas company 
files a plan. PSC may approve a plan if it finds that the investments and estimated costs of 

END OF PAGE 20

START OF PAGE 21
    
HB 1035/ Page 21 
eligible infrastructure replacement projects are reasonable and prudent and designed to 
improve public safety or infrastructure reliability over the short and long term. PSC must 
approve the cost recovery schedule associated with a plan at the same time that it approves 
a plan. 
 
The surcharge applies for five years from the date of initial implementation of an approved 
plan. Costs are reviewed by PSC each year and the surcharge is adjusted to account for any 
difference between actual and recovered costs (unless PSC determines higher costs were 
reasonably and prudently incurred, in which case PSC must authorize an increase in the 
surcharge to recover the difference). In a base rate proceeding subsequent to the approval 
of a plan, PSC must take into account any benefits realized by the gas company as a result 
of an approved surcharge. 
 
 
Specific Rate Schedules for Large Load Customers 
 
 
Electric Company Rates and Customer Connections with Excess Costs:  PSC must, 
by regulation or order, require the unbundling of electric company rates, charges, and 
services into standardized categories determined by the commission, including distribution 
and transmission, customer charges, and taxes. PSC regulations require each electric 
company to file a copy of its tariff with the commission, which must include: 
 
 
each schedule of rates for service, together with applicable riders; and 
 
the company’s rules, or terms and conditions, describing its policies and practices 
in rendering service. 
 
The policies and practices must include, among other information, the company’s plan for 
the installation of main and service lines where these facilities are in excess of those 
included in the regular rates for service and for which the customer must be required to pay 
all or part of the cost. The customer’s payments should be related to the investment that 
the company prudently can make in consideration of the probable revenue. 
 
 
Rate Discrimination Generally Prohibited:  Except in limited specified 
circumstances, for any service rendered or commodity furnished, a public service company 
may not directly or indirectly, by any means, including special rates, rebates, drawbacks, 
or refunds: 
 
 
charge, demand, or receive from a person compensation that is greater or less than 
from any other person under substantially similar circumstances; 
 
extend a privilege or facility to a person, except those privileges and facilities that 
are extended uniformly to all persons under substantially similar circumstances; 
 
discriminate against a person, locality, or particular class of service; or 

END OF PAGE 21

START OF PAGE 22
    
HB 1035/ Page 22 
 
give undue or unreasonable preference to or cause undue or unreasonable prejudice 
to a person, locality, or particular class of service. 
 
For example, an exemption applies to electricity or gas service provided to eligible  
limited-income customers through a PSC-approved limited income mechanism. 
 
 
Prohibited Cost Recovery through Rates 
 
Under PSC regulations, charitable contributions, penalties, and lobbying expenses are not 
allowed for rate-making purposes. Additionally, expenses classified as promotional, 
community affairs, and institutional must be excluded as an expense for rate-making 
purposes unless a utility demonstrates during a rate case proceeding that a particular item 
of advertising or promotional expenditure was directly beneficial to the ratepayer and in 
the public interest. 
 
“Promotional” means directed toward selling services or promoting the addition of new 
customers or seeking additional use of utility service. “Community affairs” means directed 
toward influencing public opinion on a controversial issue, or the result of any legislative 
or administrative matter that would justify the utility civic and community position. 
“Institutional” means directed toward establishing a favorable image of the utility company 
or its employees and which serves to identify the sponsor. 
 
 
Wage and Labor Requirements for Utility Contractors 
 
Chapters 12 and 21 of the 2021 special session required an investor-owned gas company, 
electric company, or gas and electric company to require contractors and subcontractors on 
specified underground infrastructure projects to pay their employees at least the applicable 
prevailing wage rate. Chapter 336 of 2023 required the Maryland Department of Labor to 
enforce the requirement and specified that the applicable prevailing wage rate is the one 
solely determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, in a process substantially 
similar to the process for determining prevailing wage rates on public works contracts. 
Chapter 595 of 2024 specified that the requirements must be construed to apply 
retroactively and must be applied to and interpreted to affect contracts entered into on or 
after March 1, 2024. 
 
Public Service Commission 
 
 
Generally 
 
PSC must supervise and regulate public service companies, which includes electric 
companies, subject to its jurisdiction to (1) ensure their operation in the interest of the 
public and (2) promote adequate, economical, and efficient delivery of utility services in 

END OF PAGE 22

START OF PAGE 23
    
HB 1035/ Page 23 
the State without unjust discrimination. In doing so, PSC must consider the public safety, 
the economy of the State, the maintenance of fair and stable labor standards for affected 
workers, the conservation of natural resources, the preservation of environmental quality, 
the achievement of the State’s climate commitments for reducing GHG emissions, and the 
protection of a public service company’s infrastructure against cybersecurity threats. PSC 
must also enforce compliance with legal requirements by public service companies. 
 
 
Long-term Electricity Supply 
 
In order to meet long-term, anticipated demand in the State for standard offer service and 
other electricity supply, PSC may require or allow an investor-owned electric company to 
construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities, and transmission 
facilities necessary to interconnect the generating facilities with the electric grid, subject to 
appropriate cost recovery. 
 
 
Power Plant Siting 
 
PSC is the lead agency for licensing the siting, construction, and operation of power plants 
and related facilities in the State through CPCNs. For general information on the CPCN 
process, see the Appendix – Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. 
 
Under COMAR 20.79.01.07, unless otherwise directed by PSC, a decision on CPCN 
application for the construction of an electric generating station must be rendered within 
365 days from the date a complete application is filed. A decision on an application for 
modification or an existing generating station must be made within 150 days. 
 
 
Co-location 
 
Chapter 537 of 2024 required PSC to study and make recommendations on issues related 
to the utilization of end-use electricity customer load that is physically connected to the 
facilities of an existing or planned electric generation facility, also known as co-located 
load configuration or co-location. PSC was required to report its findings and 
recommendations to the Senate Committee on Education, Energy, and the Environment 
and the House Economic Matters Committee by December 15, 2024. PSC established 
Public Conference 61 to address these topics and requested comments from relevant 
stakeholders, which, along with several Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
proceedings, informed the final report. 
 
The report focuses on an emerging co-location arrangement in which a load co-locates with 
a generator that is interconnected to the grid but is situated behind the generator’s meter. 
Under this arrangement, a load (such as a data center) sets up its facilities to offtake 
electricity directly from the generator instead of interconnecting directly with the electric 

END OF PAGE 23

START OF PAGE 24
    
HB 1035/ Page 24 
grid. In this scenario, some or all of the generator’s capacity could be reserved for the 
exclusive use of the co-located load, in which case it would not be considered available to 
serve the wider electric grid. The report labels this arrangement a “Type B” configuration, 
in contrast to a “Type A” configuration that still interconnects to the grid. 
 
The report addresses the various impacts on reliability, rates, and regional energy market 
of co-location and concludes that “some forms of co-location represent novel approaches 
to connecting load to the grid. However, certain other co-location proposals have the 
potential to create immediate and significant challenges to the grid, impacting overall 
resource adequacy and rates charged to customers. These approaches may warrant changes 
in the [Public Utilities Article] and future consideration as variations on those approaches 
develop.” Specific recommendations in the report include the following. 
 
 
The General Assembly should confirm in statute that the load in a co-location 
arrangement is a retail electric customer, addressing the arrangement as a retail 
electric sale subject to PSC jurisdiction. 
 
The General Assembly should clarify whether generators that engage in a “Type B” 
(generally, “behind-the-meter”) co-location arrangement violate utility franchise 
agreements under the definition of electric company, or if they should be granted an 
exception and what the terms of that exception may be. 
 
The General Assembly should clarify the distinction between retail net metering and 
a Type-B co-location arrangement. 
 
The General Assembly should make clear whether the electric company, through 
which tariffs can be assigned, is the utility in whose territory the load resides. 
Additionally, or alternatively, the General Assembly should make clear whether any 
co-location party is an electric company or an electricity supplier, thereby requiring 
it to meet State renewable energy requirements. 
 
The General Assembly should require costs for programs like the Electric Universal 
Service Program and EmPOWER Maryland, as well as other costs that may be 
deemed appropriate, be allocated to large co-located loads. 
 
The General Assembly should ensure that there are rules in place to impose penalties 
on a co-location arrangement at which load unexpectedly comes onto the grid to 
preclude the risk of reliability challenges, along with related cybersecurity 
requirements. 
 
The General Assembly should define the degree of control the State should exercise 
over co-location arrangements in Maryland, such as a review process similar to 
CPCNs for determining whether each proposed co-location instance is in the public 
interest before it is allowed to proceed. 

END OF PAGE 24

START OF PAGE 25
    
HB 1035/ Page 25 
 
Large co-located loads should be encouraged to bring new, clean energy generation 
with them. 
 
 
Maryland Energy Storage Program 
 
Chapter 570 of 2023 required PSC to establish the Maryland Energy Storage Program and 
establish targets for the cost-effective deployment of new energy storage devices in the 
State with a goal of achieving at least a cumulative total of 750 megawatts by the end of 
the 2027 PJM delivery year, 1,500 megawatts by the end of the 2030 PJM delivery year, 
and 3,000 megawatts by the end of the 2033 PJM delivery year. If a target cannot be met 
cost effectively, the target must be reduced to the maximum cost-effective amount for the 
relevant delivery year. The program must be implemented by July 1, 2025, as specified. 
 
Chapter 427 of 2019 required PSC to establish an Energy Storage Pilot Program by 
June 1, 2019. Under the program, each of the State’s four investor-owned electric 
companies was required to request proposals for two energy storage projects and apply for 
PSC approval. The cumulative size of the pilot projects under the program must be between 
5 megawatts and 10 megawatts. 
 
 
Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard 
 
Waste-to-energy and refuse-derived fuel are eligible Tier 1 resources under the State RPS. 
The terms are not further defined in statute or regulation. Annual RPS compliance reports 
by PSC categorize “waste-to-energy” in statute as “municipal solid waste.” There are 
two such facilities located in Maryland:  a privately owned incinerator in Baltimore City 
and a county owned incinerator in Montgomery County. 
 
ACP revenues have been significant in recent years, with total ACPs of $320.4 million 
from compliance year 2023, mostly due to a shortfall in Tier 1 renewable energy credits 
(RECs) that year. 
 
For additional information, see the Appendix – Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard. 
 
State Agency Procurements 
 
 
Generally 
 
Subject to specified exceptions, the Board of Public Works (BPW) controls procurement 
for Executive Branch agencies, but statute authorizes BPW to delegate its authority to other 
agencies. The Code of Maryland Regulations delegates some of BPW’s procurement 
authority, with the Office of State Procurement within the Department of General Services 
(DGS) given oversight of procurements for construction, construction-related services, 

END OF PAGE 25

START OF PAGE 26
    
HB 1035/ Page 26 
commodities, services, and more. However, procurements valued at more than $200,000 
still require BPW approval. DGS further delegates authority for small procurements – those 
valued at less than $100,000 – to individual agencies. 
 
Competitive sealed bids are an authorized procurement method under State procurement 
law and are generally used for procurements in which lowest bid price is the sole criteria 
used in determining an award. DLS notes that competitive sealed proposals, also an 
authorized procurement method under State law, are more frequently used when factors 
other than price (such as the qualifications of a consultant) are to be used in determining 
an award. 
 
Minority Business Enterprise Program 
 
The State’s MBE Program requires that a statewide goal for MBE contract participation be 
established biennially through the regulatory process under the Administrative Procedure 
Act. The goal has been 29% since 2014. The Maryland Department of Transportation 
(MDOT) is designated in State regulations as the State’s MBE certification agency. An 
MBE is a legal entity, other than a joint venture, that is: 
 
 
organized to engage in commercial transactions; 


State Fiscal Effect:  Significant effects of the bill are discussed separately below, 
organized by State agency. This analysis assumes no substantive fiscal effect in fiscal 2025, 
despite the bill’s June 1, 2025 effective date. Operational effects on any agencies not 
discussed below are assumed to be generally minimal and absorbable within existing 
budgeted resources, although there may be minor or incidental costs not captured due to 
the extent of the bill. The effect on State expenditures for electricity is discussed in the 
Additional Comments section below. 
 
Department of Housing and Community Development  
 
DCHD advises that it expects to provide loans under the bill for certain covered buildings 
through its GHG Reduction Program. Typical terms of similar loans are 0% interest, with 
deferred repayments, and maturities ranging from 15 to 40 years. DHCD also advises that 
it expects most loans to not be repaid. However, in limited circumstances when repayments 
do occur (such as at maturity, or when a property is no longer used as a rental housing 
project), those amounts accrue to DHCD and are made available for other purposes under 

END OF PAGE 26

START OF PAGE 27
    
HB 1035/ Page 27 
the same program. The amount of annual funding provided through the State budget is not 
affected by the bill. DHCD can also handle any additional administrative requirements with 
existing staff. Accordingly, this provision does not materially affect State finances or 
operations, particularly through fiscal 2030. 
 
Expanding eligible funding sources for GHG savings allows existing federal and State 
funding to count toward meeting DHCD’s GHG reductions targets under the EmPOWER 
Maryland Program. Absent the bill, DHCD must amend its implementation plan with PSC 
and request additional EmPOWER ratepayer funds to make up the savings from the 
funding sources that no longer count toward the targets. Those ratepayer funds are collected 
by electric companies and remitted to DHCD as special funds. Accordingly, the bill 
significantly reduces special fund revenues and expenditures for DHCD, most likely 
beginning in fiscal 2026, from what they would otherwise be. While actual amounts are 
unknown at this time, DHCD advises that about half of its EmPOWER program is funded 
through ratepayer funds – approximately $60 million in fiscal 2026. 
 
Public Service Commission  
 
 
Administrative Costs  
 
The bill creates significant new and incremental requirements for PSC that cannot be 
absorbed within existing resources. Generally, PSC must implement and/or administer the 
energy programs established by the bill:  those for distribution-connected energy storage 
devices, transmission energy storage devices, expedited CPCNs, nuclear energy, and, in at 
least fiscal 2026, ratepayer refunds. The bill also establishes other one-time and ongoing 
responsibilities for PSC related to utility ratemaking and regulation. 
 
PSC advises that it requires eight staff to implement the various requirements, plus ongoing 
consultant technical assistance of approximately $1.5 million annually through at least 
fiscal 2030. Consultant costs should be considered an approximate annual average and may 
vary significantly depending on PSC needs in a particular fiscal year. 
 
Accordingly, special fund expenditures for PSC increase by $2,467,805 in fiscal 2026, 
which accounts for a 30-day startup delay. This estimate reflects the cost of hiring 
three program managers, three attorneys, one engineer, and one climate policy analyst to 
implement the various programs and regulatory requirements. It includes salaries, fringe 
benefits, one-time start-up costs, ongoing operating expenses, and $1.5 million in 
consultant costs.

expenses and ongoing consultant costs. 
 
Generally, PSC is funded through an assessment on the public service companies that it 
regulates. As a result, special fund revenues for PSC increase correspondingly from 
assessments imposed on public service companies.  
 
 
Ratepayer Credit from Alternative Compliance Payments 
 
The bill specifies that a portion of ACP revenues in SEIF must be used to provide grant 
awards to electric companies to be refunded or credited to residential distribution 
customers for electric service in fiscal 2026. The fiscal 2026 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly authorizes the Governor to transfer by budget amendment up to  
$200 million from ACP revenues in SEIF to PSC to be awarded to electric companies, 
including electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities, for that purpose, contingent 
on enactment of this bill or its cross file. This analysis assumes that the maximum amount 
of funding is transferred. 
 
Accordingly, special fund expenditures for PSC increase by $200 million in fiscal 2026 as 
ACP revenues are allocated to electric companies to provide residential ratepayer bill 
credits. There are approximately 2.4 million residential electric customers in the State; 
$200 million allocated evenly across those customers would provide $82 per account, split 
equally between a $41 summer bill credit and a $41 winter bill credit. DLS notes that the 
State RPS does not apply to Choptank Electric Cooperative.  
 
Additionally, provisions altering SEIF to allow for grants to electric companies for 
residential ratepayer credits are permanent; special fund expenditures for PSC increase in 
future years to the extent that additional funds are used for that purpose. 
 
Office of People’s Counsel 
 
OPC reviews all matters in front of PSC for ratepayer impacts; the new and complex energy 
programs administered by PSC under the bill require a commensurate increase in OPC staff 
and consultant services beginning in fiscal 2026. OPC anticipates requiring two dedicated 
attorneys to represent OPC in the numerous resulting regulatory proceedings and ongoing

consultant assistance of up to $250,000 annually to assist in evaluating ratepayer impacts. 
Consultant costs should be considered an approximate annual average and may vary from 
this estimate depending on OPC’s caseload in a particular fiscal year. 
 
Accordingly, special fund expenditures for OPC increase by $527,541 in fiscal 2026, which 
accounts for a 30-day startup delay. This estimate reflects the cost of hiring two attorneys 
to participate in the PSC procurement processes and other regulatory proceedings required 
by the bill. It includes salaries, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, ongoing operating 
expenses, and $250,000 in consultant costs.

OPC is also funded through assessments on public service companies; thus, any additional 
special fund expenditures are funded through a corresponding increase in special fund 
revenues from assessments imposed on public service companies. 
 
Department of Natural Resources 
 
The bill creates significant new and incremental requirements for DNR’s PPRP that cannot 
be absorbed within existing resources. PPRP requires additional technical and legal staff 
as well as funding for consultants to meet anticipated workloads associated with the various 
energy programs and other administrative requirements established by the bill.  
 
In general, special funds from the Environmental Trust Fund are used to fund PPRP’s 
operations. However, general funds may be required to cover part or all of the expenses 
that PPRP incurs under the bill because the department anticipates a special fund revenue 
shortfall. 
 
Accordingly, general/special fund expenditures for DNR increase by $822,795 in 
fiscal 2026, which accounts for a 120-day startup delay. This estimate reflects the cost of 
hiring five power plant siting assessors and one attorney, primarily to assist with additional 
CPCN analyses. It includes salaries, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, ongoing 
operating expenses, and $250,000 in consultant costs.

Administrative Costs  
 
MEA advises that it requires the assistance of consultants with its responsibilities under 
the bill related to nuclear cost-sharing and siting agreements and the associated reporting 
requirement, at a one-time cost of $150,000. Costs are assumed to be paid for using SEIF 
in fiscal 2026. Accordingly, special fund expenditures for MEA (specifically, SEIF) 
increase by $150,000 in fiscal 2026. 
 
 
Ratepayer Credit from Alternative Compliance Payments 
 
As described above, the bill specifies that a portion of ACP revenues in SEIF must be used 
to provide grant awards to electric companies to be refunded or credited to residential 
distribution customers for electric service in fiscal 2026. The fiscal 2026 budget authorizes 
the Governor to transfer by budget amendment up to $200 million from ACP revenues in 
SEIF to PSC for that purpose, contingent on enactment of this bill or its cross file. This 
analysis assumes that the maximum amount of funding is transferred. 
 
Based on the size of the assumed transfer, special fund expenditures for SEIF decrease in 
future years as those funds are no longer available for MEA programs. Examples of such 
programs include the Solar Resiliency Hubs Program, the Solar Energy Equity Program, 
the Decarbonizing Public Schools Program, and the Customer-Sited Solar Grant Program. 
 
Additionally, provisions altering SEIF to allow for grants to electric companies for 
residential ratepayer credits are permanent; special fund expenditures for SEIF are affected 
in future years to the extent that additional funds are used for that purpose. 
 
Department of General Services 
 
DGS advises that provisions in the bill authorizing legislative fast-track procurements for 
specified agencies have an operational and fiscal impact. More specifically, while those 

END OF PAGE 30

START OF PAGE 31
    
HB 1035/ Page 31 
five agencies may conduct larger procurements in certain circumstances instead of DGS, 
the department must still oversee the procurement, and CPO or the CPO’s designee must 
approve each procurement contract within five business days, or the contract is considered 
approved. DLS notes that any procurement with a value of at least $200,000 requires 
approval by BPW; the bill does not exempt “fast-track” procurements that exceed that level 
from BPW’s review and approval process. Based on its assessment for a potentially 
significant number of legislative fast-track procurements each year, DGS advises that it 
requires five additional procurement officers to meet the bill’s requirements, with 
total annual costs of approximately $500,000 to $650,000. 
 
DLS cannot independently verify the need for five additional procurement officers at this 
time. The number of future affected consultant procurements is unknown, and DGS would 
otherwise be responsible for any of those procurements not directly caused by the bill. 
However, to the extent that the department requires additional staff, general fund 
expenditures for DGS increase by approximately $100,000 to $130,000 annually per staff, 
beginning as early as fiscal 2026. 
 
Maryland Department of the Environment 
 
While the bill does not directly assign responsibilities to MDE, the various energy 
programs likely result in increased workload for the department as, among other things, 
proposed projects seek required permits from the department. This estimate assumes 
existing staff and permitting processes can generally handle these requirements. Revenues 
from affected permits issued by MDE accrue to at least the Maryland Clean Air Fund and 
the Maryland Clean Water Fund. Accordingly, special fund revenues for MDE increase by 
an unknown, but likely modest, amount beginning in fiscal 2026. 
 
Maryland Department of Transportation 
 
To comply with the bill’s requirement that GOSBA establish a clear plan for setting MBE 
participation goals, MDOT, as the State’s MBE certification agency, must conduct a 
disparity study to determine whether and how much a disparity exists in the use of MBEs 
by nuclear power facilities. Although a new statewide disparity study is due to be 
completed in September 2025, it likely does not include the analysis necessary for this bill. 
To the extent that a separate disparity analysis must be completed and based on costs for 
similar studies in the past, Transportation Trust Fund expenditures likely increase by 
approximately $150,000 for MDOT to conduct a disparity study on the use of MBEs by 
nuclear facilities. This estimate assumes those costs are incurred in fiscal 2026, although 
costs may be incurred in subsequent years. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The bill has many potential effects on local government operations 
and finances. Among the potential effects: 

END OF PAGE 31

START OF PAGE 32
    
HB 1035/ Page 32 
 
The State’s five municipal electric utilities are generally not exempt from any 
provisions in the bill and are, therefore, affected like any other electric company 
(i.e., providing funding for eligible projects under the programs through various 
incentive structures and distributing rate refunds or credits). The five municipal 
electric utilities are located in Berlin (Worcester County), Easton (Talbot County), 
Hagerstown 
(Washington 
County), 
Thurmont 
(Frederick 
County), 
and 
Williamsport (Washington County). The bill specifically prohibits the use of 
ratepayer refund monies from being used for administrative expenses. 
 
Local governments likely have administrative requirements associated with project 
siting and permitting. 
 
Local governments may receive less funding from ACP-funded programs, such as 
from MEA’s Decarbonizing Public Schools Program. 
 
Waste-to-energy and refuse derived fuel are removed from eligibility for inclusion 
in the State RPS for public-owned facilities, effective July 1, 2026. 
Montgomery County, the only local government that currently owns a 
waste-to-energy facility, must sell the associated RECs to other states for 
compliance in other states, rather than Maryland, to continue receiving revenue. To 
the extent there are no other buyers for these RECs, or other state REC prices are 
lower than Maryland’s, county revenues decrease. Whether any other state RPS 
programs accept, or will accept, Maryland waste-to-energy RECs going forward is 
unknown, although it does not appear to be a common eligible source in the region. 
The county estimates its revenues decrease by $12.2 million annually beginning in 
fiscal 2027 due to the change. 
 
Local governments, as electric customers, are affected by any change in electricity 
rates, as discussed in the Additional Comments section below. 
 
Small Business Effect:  The bill establishes several new clean energy and energy storage 
incentive programs but also reduces funding for ACP-backed clean energy programs – the 
net effect on a particular small business in the affected industries is unknown but could be 
significant. Additionally, all small businesses, and particularly small businesses with 
significant electricity use, are affected by any change in electricity rates, as discussed in 
the Additional Comments section below. 
 
Additional Comments:  The overall effect on electricity rates due to the bill is unclear, 
although the size of the potential programs – multiple thousands of megawatts, the capacity 
equivalent of several Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plants – means there is potential for a 
significant rate effect. Broadly, the effects of the ratepayer-funded incentives established 
for new nuclear and energy storage will be offset, at least in part, by the savings attributable 
to the resulting local energy generation and storage capacity created. Also, in the near-term, 
the more than 3,100 megawatts of new capacity potentially approved through expedited 
CPCNs would likely alleviate, at least in part, energy constraints on the local region’s 

END OF PAGE 32

START OF PAGE 33
    
HB 1035/ Page 33 
electric grid. Additionally, the bill’s requirements for large-load customers and co-location 
arrangements, along with changes to multi-year rate plans and cost recovery under the 
STRIDE program, may mitigate future distribution rate increases. 
 
Specific to the removal of waste-to-energy and refuse-derived fuel from RPS eligibility, 
the associated RECs are not substantially cheaper than average, and average REC prices 
are near ACPs. The provision likely has a minimal impact on compliance costs and, by 
extension, a minimal impact on electricity rates.  
 
Specific to residential customers, the residential rate credit required by the bill in 
fiscal 2026, if $200 million is provided as authorized in the fiscal 2026 budget, would 
provide an average of $82 per account, split equally between a $41 summer bill credit and 
a $41 winter bill credit. There is also the potential for additional refunds in future years, as 
the relevant provisions altering SEIF are permanent. Additionally, the bill significantly 
reduces ratepayer funds that would be required to be collected by electric companies and 
remitted to DHCD to fund its EmPOWER programs. DHCD programs are typically funded 
through residential rates. 
 
In any case, the State, local governments, and all businesses, including small businesses, 
are affected by the potential significant change in electricity rates due to the bill.

Appendix – Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity 
 
 
General Overview 
 
The Public Service Commission (PSC) is the lead agency for licensing the siting, 
construction, and operation of power plants and related facilities in the State through 
Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN). The CPCN process is 
comprehensive and involves several other State agencies, including the Department of 
Natural Resources (and its Power Plant Research Program), and the Maryland Department 
of the Environment. Subject to limited exemptions described below, a person may not 
begin construction in the State of a generating station, overhead transmission line, or 
qualified generator lead line unless a CPCN is first obtained from PSC. 
 
State law provides that a “generating station” excludes: 
 
 
a facility used for electricity production with a capacity of up to 2 megawatts that is 
installed with equipment that prevents the flow of electricity to the electric grid 
during time periods when the grid is out of service; 
 
a combination of two or more co-located or adjacent facilities used for electricity 
production 
from 
solar 
photovoltaic 
systems 
or 
specified 
eligible 
customer-generators that have a maximum cumulative capacity of 14 megawatts, 
including maximum individual capacities of 2 megawatts (subject to satisfying other 
requirements); and 
 
a facility, or a combination of two or more facilities, used for electricity production 
for the purpose of onsite emergency backup for critical infrastructure when service 
from the electric company is interrupted and conducting necessary test and 
maintenance operations (subject to satisfying other requirements). 
 
The CPCN process, detailed further below, involves the notification of specified 
stakeholders, the holding of public hearings, the consideration of recommendations by 
State and local government entities, and the consideration of the project’s effects on various 
aspects of the State infrastructure, economy, and environment. 
 
In December 2020, PSC initiated a rulemaking (RM 72) to revise regulations governing 
CPCNs for generating stations. Updated regulations became effective in September 2021. 
Among other changes, the regulations contain additional information requirements – to 
assist in project evaluation – and allow for electronic submission and distribution of 
application materials. 
 
 

END OF PAGE 35

START OF PAGE 36
    
HB 1035/ Page 36 
Notification Process 
 
Upon receipt of a CPCN application, PSC – or the CPCN applicant, if required by PSC – 
must immediately provide notice to specified recipients, including the executive and 
governing body of affected local governments, affected members of the General Assembly, 
and other interested persons. When providing the notice, PSC must also forward the CPCN 
application to each appropriate unit of State and local government for review, evaluation, 
and comment and to each member of the General Assembly who requests a copy. 
 
Public Hearing and Comment 
 
PSC must provide an opportunity for public comment and hold a public hearing on a 
CPCN application in each county and municipality in which any portion of the construction 
of a generating station, overhead transmission line, or qualified generator lead line is 
proposed to be located. PSC must hold the hearing jointly with the governing body of the 
county or municipality and must provide weekly notice during the four weeks prior to the 
hearing, both in a newspaper and online, and must further coordinate with each local 
government to identify additional hearing notification options. PSC must ensure 
presentation and recommendations from each interested State unit and must allow 
representatives of each State unit to sit during the hearing of all parties. PSC must then 
allow each State unit 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing to modify the unit’s initial 
recommendations. 
 
Public Service Commission Considerations 
 
PSC must take final action on a CPCN application only after due consideration of 
(1) recommendations of the governing body of each county or municipality in which any 
portion of the project is proposed to be located; (2) various aspects of the State 
infrastructure, economy, and environment; and (3) the effect of climate change on the 
project. For example, PSC must consider the effect of the project on the stability and 
reliability of the electric system and, when applicable, air and water pollution. There are 
additional considerations specifically for a generating station or an overhead transmission 
line. For example, PSC must consider the impact of a generating station on the quantity of 
annual and long-term statewide GHG emissions and must consider alternative routes and 
related costs for the construction of a new overhead transmission line. 
 
Generating Station Exemptions 
 
There are three general conditions under which a person constructing a generating station 
may apply to PSC for an exemption from the CPCN requirement: 
 

END OF PAGE 36

START OF PAGE 37
    
HB 1035/ Page 37 
 
the facility is designed to provide onsite generated electricity, the capacity is up to 
70 megawatts, and the excess electricity can be sold only on the wholesale market 
pursuant to a specified agreement with the local electric company; 
 
at least 10% of the electricity generated is consumed onsite, the capacity is up to 
25 megawatts, and the excess electricity is sold on the wholesale market pursuant 
to a specified agreement with the local electric company; or 
 
the facility is wind-powered and land-based, the capacity is up to 70 megawatts, and 
the facility is no closer than a PSC-determined distance from the Patuxent River 
Naval Air Station, among other requirements. 
 
However, PSC must require a person who is exempted from the CPCN requirement to 
obtain approval from the commission before the person may construct a generating station 
as described above. The application must contain specified information that PSC requires, 
including proof of compliance with all applicable requirements of the independent system 
operator.

HB 1035/ Page 38 
Appendix – Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard 
 
 
General Overview 
 
Maryland’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) was enacted in 2004 to facilitate 
a gradual transition to renewable sources of energy. There are specified eligible (“Tier 1” 
or “Tier 2”) sources as well as carve-outs for solar, offshore wind, and geothermal. Electric 
companies (utilities) and other electricity suppliers must submit renewable energy credits 
(RECs) equal to a percentage of their retail electricity sales specified in statute each year 
or else pay an alternative compliance payment (ACP) equivalent to their shortfall. 
Historically, RPS requirements have been met almost entirely through RECs, with 
negligible reliance on ACPs; however, as discussed further below, that has not been the 
case more recently. Generally, the Maryland Energy Administration must use ACPs for 
purposes related to renewable energy, as specified. 
 
In 2025, the requirements are 35.5% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 7.0% from solar 
and 0.25% from post-2022 geothermal systems, plus 2.5% from Tier 2 sources. 
 
Recent Significant Changes to Overall Percentage Requirements 
 
 
Chapter 757 of 2019 significantly increased the percentage requirements, which 
now escalate over time to a minimum of 50% from Tier 1 sources, including 
14.5% from solar, by 2030. 
 
 
Chapter 673 of 2021 reduced the amount of solar energy required under the RPS 
each year from 2022 through 2029, while leaving the nonsolar requirement 
generally unchanged, before realigning with the previous requirements beginning in 
2030. The Act also extended Tier 2 in perpetuity at 2.5%. 
 
 
Chapter 164 of 2021 created a carve-out for post-2022 geothermal systems in Tier 1 
beginning in 2023. 
 
Limited Applicability to Municipal Electric Utilities and Electric Cooperatives 
 
As RPS percentage requirements have grown over time, legislation has been enacted to 
limit the effect on municipal electric utilities and electric cooperatives. Tier 1 percentage 
requirements for municipal electric utilities are limited to 20.4% in total beginning in 2021, 
including at least 1.95% from solar energy and up to 2.5% from offshore wind. Municipal 
electric utilities are also exempt from Tier 2 after 2021. Electric cooperatives are exempt 

END OF PAGE 38

START OF PAGE 39
    
HB 1035/ Page 39 
from future increases to the solar carve-out beyond 2.5%, and the RPS does not apply to 
Choptank Electric Cooperative. 
 
Renewable Energy Credits 
 
Generally, a REC is a tradable commodity equal to one megawatt-hour of electricity 
generated or obtained from a renewable energy generation resource. In other words, a REC 
represents the “generation attributes” of renewable energy – the lack of carbon emissions, 
its renewable nature, etc. A REC has a five-year life during which it may be transferred, 
sold, or redeemed. REC generators and electricity suppliers are allowed to trade RECs 
using a Public Service Commission (PSC) approved system known as the Generation 
Attributes Tracking System, a trading platform designed and operated by PJM 
Environmental Information Services, Inc., that tracks the ownership and trading of RECs. 
 
Eligible Sources 
 
Tier 1 sources include wind (onshore and offshore); solar (photovoltaic and certain 
water-heating systems); qualifying biomass; methane from anaerobic decomposition of 
organic materials in a landfill or wastewater treatment plant; geothermal; ocean, including 
energy from waves, tides, currents, and thermal differences; a fuel cell that produces 
electricity from specified sources; a small hydroelectric plant of less than 30 megawatts; 
poultry litter-to-energy; waste-to-energy; refuse-derived fuel; thermal energy from a 
thermal biomass system; and raw or treated wastewater used as a heat source or sink for 
heating or cooling. Tier 2 includes only large hydroelectric power plants. 
 
Chapter 673 excluded black liquor, or any product derived from black liquor, from Tier 1 
beginning in 2022, although some black liquor RECs remain eligible through the duration 
of certain contracts. 
 
Trends in Compliance Costs, Renewable Energy Credit Prices, and Resources Used 
 
Compliance costs for electricity suppliers totaled $564.2 million in 2023:  $243.8 million 
for 7.9 million RECs and $320.4 million in ACPs. This continues a multi-year trend of 
increasing overall compliance costs, reliance on ACPs, and REC prices. Of note, 2023 was 
the first time that ACPs have been used in a significant way for general Tier 1 compliance. 
In fact, electricity suppliers retired the lowest number of general Tier 1 RECs since 2013 
– and made $262.4 million in ACPs for the remaining obligation. Compliance costs and 
REC prices for the most recent five-year period are shown in Exhibit 1. 
 
In 2023, solar (27.5%), wind (19.9%), black liquor (16.1%), municipal solid waste 
(14.2%), and small hydroelectric (7.5%) were the primary energy sources used for  
Tier 1 RPS compliance. Maryland facilities generated 5.2 million RECs in 2023:  
1.3 million Tier 1 RECs, 2.1 million Tier 1 RECs, and 1.8 million Tier 2 RECs. Many 

END OF PAGE 39

START OF PAGE 40
    
HB 1035/ Page 40 
RECs can be used for compliance in both Maryland and other surrounding states, although

Related Studies and Reports 
 
PSC must submit an RPS compliance report to the General Assembly each year. The most 
recent report, which contains historical data through 2023, can be found here. 
 
The Power Plant Research Program (PPRP) in the Department of Natural Resources has 
frequently been required to conduct RPS studies. PPRP submitted a final report on a 
comprehensive RPS study in December 2019, which can be found here. PPRP also 
submitted a related required study on nuclear energy at that time, which can be found here. 
PPRP’s supplemental study on the overall costs and benefits of increasing the RPS to a 
goal of 100% by 2040 was due by January 1, 2024. 
 
The Department of Legislative Services also issued an RPS report in 2024, which can be 
found here. The report contains additional detail on the program, significant statutory 
changes, and visualizations of planned and actual RPS percentage requirements over time.
