State Contracts - Prohibited Provisions 
 
 
This bill prohibits, unless required by State or federal law, a State contract from including 
a provision that limits the State’s ability to recover the difference in the cost of a 
replacement contractor to perform the services not performed by the original contractor, to 
the extent that the sum of the amount paid to the replacement contractor and the amount 
paid to the original contractor exceed the costs provided for in the contract with the original 
contractor. It also clarifies that, unless required by State or federal law, a State contract 
cannot include a provision that requires the State to agree to limit the liability for any direct 
loss to the State for bodily injury, death or damage to real property or tangible personal 
property of the State caused by the negligence, intentional or willful misconduct, fraudulent 
act, recklessness, or other legally actionable misconduct of a person or a person’s 
employees or agents.

Analysis 
 
Current Law:  A “State contract” means any agreement entered into by the State. Except 
as required by State or federal law, a State contract cannot include: 
 
 
a provision that requires the State to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless another 
person without an appropriation of State fund for that purpose;

 
a provision by which the State agrees to binding arbitration or any other binding 
extrajudicial dispute resolution process;  
 
a provision that names a jurisdiction or venue for any action or dispute against the 
State other than a court of proper jurisdiction in the State;  
 
a provision that requires the State to agree to limit the liability for any direct loss to 
the State for bodily injury, death, or damage to property of the State caused by the 
negligence, intentional or willful misconduct, fraudulent act, recklessness, or other 
tortious conduct of a person or a person’s employees or agents or a provision that 
would otherwise impose an indemnification obligation on the State;  
 
a provision that requires the State to be bound by a term or condition that (1) is 
unknown to the State at the time of signing a contract; (2) may be unilaterally 
changed by the other party; or (3) is electronically accepted by a State employee 
without authority;  
 
a provision that provides for a person other than the Attorney General of Maryland 
to serve as legal counsel for the State, unless provided under State law;  
 
a provision that is inconsistent with the State’s obligations under the Open Meetings 
Act or the Public Information Act;  
 
a provision that requires an agent of the State to enter into a contract that purports 
to bind the State, create a deficiency, or incur a liability unless money has been 
appropriated for that purpose and remains unspent;  
 
a provision for automatic renewal that obligates the State to allocate funding in 
subsequent fiscal years; or 
 
a provision that limits the State’s ability to recover the cost of a replacement 
contractor. 
 
If a State contract does contain one of provisions on this list, that specific provision is 
considered void, and the contract is enforceable as if it did not contain that provision.
