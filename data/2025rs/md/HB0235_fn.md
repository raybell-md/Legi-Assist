This departmental bill makes various clarifying and administrative changes to the State’s 
regulatory framework governing State and local cybersecurity, generally clarifying and 
distinguishing the responsibilities between the Department of Information Technology 
(DoIT) and the Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM). The bill also 
requires the Office of Security Management (OSM) within DoIT to submit an annual report 
by the third Wednesday in January each year to specified committees of the 
General Assembly on (1) the State’s expenditures on cybersecurity relative to overall 
information technology spending for the prior three years and (2) recommendations for 
changes to the budget, as specified, to improve State and local cybersecurity preparedness. 
In a year with a newly elected Governor, the report is instead due by the third Friday of 
January.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  Chapters 241, 242, and 243 of 2022 expanded and 
enhanced the State’s regulatory framework for State and local government cybersecurity. 
Among other things, the Acts required additional funding for cybersecurity, established 
leadership positions in State government for cybersecurity, codified existing cybersecurity 
requirements from a previous executive order, and requiring State and local governments 
to perform cybersecurity preparedness assessments. Directly relevant to the bill, the Acts: 
 
 
established the Cyber Preparedness Unit (CPU) within MDEM and require the unit 
to, among other duties, support local governments in developing a vulnerability 
assessment and cyber assessment and develop and regularly update an online 
database of cybersecurity training resources, including specified resources; 
 
codified and expanded the duties of OSM; 
 
required OSM to provide an annual report with specified information about the 
office’s cybersecurity activities to specified committees of the General Assembly; 
and 
 
specified the duties of the Secretary of Information Technology as they related to 
cybersecurity. 
 
The bill modifies the State’s regulatory cybersecurity framework by:   
 
 
transferring the responsibility for supporting local governments in developing 
vulnerability assessments and cyber assessments from CPU to OSM; 
 
repealing the requirement that CPU develop and regularly update training resources 
for local governments related to malware and ransomware detection; 
 
clarifying that OSM may take or direct actions required to mitigate a threat affecting 
or potentially affecting an entity connected to the State-owned Internet network 
when a connection may introduce a serious risk to other entities connected to the 
network; 
 
clarifying that OSM is not responsible assisting specified local government entities 
in the development of cybersecurity preparedness and response plans; 
 
repealing the requirement that OSM’s annual report include (1) an analysis of the 
State’s expenditures on cybersecurity relative to overall information technology 
spending for the prior three years and (2) recommendations for changes to the 
budget, including amount, purpose, and timing to improve State and local 
cybersecurity preparedness; and 
 
clarifying that the Secretary of Information is responsible for implementing 
information technology policies, procedures, and standards and a statewide 
cybersecurity strategy in addition to developing, maintaining, revising, and

enforcing the policies, procedures, and standards, and developing and maintaining 
the strategy. 
 
Background:  DoIT advises that the bill is necessary to clarify the roles and 
responsibilities of DoIT and MDEM with respect to the cybersecurity services and supports 
established by Chapters 241, 242, and 243. 
 
DoIT advises that the bill’s changes reflect the areas of expertise of each agency, ensuring 
that DoIT is responsible for the highly technical cybersecurity work and MDEM is 
responsible for assisting local governments with planning and exercising activities. MDEM 
advises that the bill’s changes reflect the current practices and activities of CPU.
