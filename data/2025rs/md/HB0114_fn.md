Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Restatement of Existing Law without Substantive Change 
 
The bill restates, without substantive change, existing law regarding (1) the commercial 
application of a “general use pesticide” (defined in the bill as a pesticide that is not a 
restricted use pesticide) and (2) the responsibility and liability of certified pest control 
applicators, certified public agency applicators, and certified private applicators.  
 
Application of Restricted Use Pesticides by Noncertified Individuals 
 
The bill makes the following changes with respect to the application of restricted use 
pesticides by noncertified individuals:   
 
 
Commercial Application – The bill repeals a provision that allows for the 
commercial application of a restricted pesticide under the supervision of a certified 
pest control applicator or certified public agency applicator and instead requires that 
each commercial application of a restricted use pesticide be done by a certified pest 
control applicator or certified public agency applicator, eliminating the ability of a 
noncertified individual to do a commercial application of a restricted use pesticide 
under the supervision of a certified pest control applicator or certified public agency 
applicator.  
 
 
Private (Agriculture) Application – The bill establishes additional requirements that 
must be met in order for a noncertified individual to do a private application of a 
restricted use pesticide under the supervision of a certified private (agriculture) 
applicator:  (1) the noncertified individual must be working under the direct 
supervision of a certified private applicator who is certified in the specific category 
of application being utilized by the individual; and (2) the certified private 
applicator 
must ensure that specified federal requirements (those in 
40 C.F.R § 171.201(b)(3)) are met.  
 
Repeal of Provisions Governing Cyclodiene Termiticides 
 
The bill repeals provisions governing the distribution, sale, offer for sale, and application 
of cyclodiene termiticides (classified as restricted use pesticides).

HB 114/ Page 3 
Repeal of Provisions Governing Antifouling Paint Containing Tributyltin 
 
The bill repeals provisions governing the distribution, possession, sale, offer for sale, use, 
or offer for use of antifouling paint containing a tributyltin compound (and any substance 
that contains a tributyltin compound in concentrated form labeled for mixing with paint by 
the user to produce an antifouling paint for use on a vessel).  
 
Current Law:   
 
Pesticide Application 
 
 
Certified Applicators 
 
Under the Pesticide Applicator’s Law, (1) each pest control applicator or public agency 
applicator must obtain an annual certificate indicating competence in one or more 
established categories from the Secretary of Agriculture (see the categories established in 
COMAR 15.05.01.08A) and (2) each private (agriculture) applicator must obtain a 
certificate requiring periodic renewal as determined by the Secretary (every three years – 
see COMAR 15.05.01.07D and E). Applicants for a certificate must pass a written 
examination, and the Secretary must establish, by rule or regulation, qualifications for 
certification to assure competence and responsibility in the application of pesticides (see 
the qualifications established in COMAR 15.05.01.08B and 15.05.01.07).  
 
“Pest control” means engaging in, or offering to engage in, recommending, advertising, 
soliciting the use of, supervising the use of, or using, a pesticide or a device for the 
identification, control, eradication, mitigation, detection, inspection, or prevention of a pest 
in, on, or around any house, building, water, air, land, plant, structure, or animal.  
 
“Pest control applicator” means a person engaged in the business of pest control, including, 
except as provided by the Secretary, a person who applies pesticides on any premises where 
the public is commonly invited for the sale of goods or services.  
 
“Public agency applicator” means a person employed by a unit of federal, State, county, or 
local government or any training institution which is engaged in pest control.  
 
“Private applicator” means a person who uses a restricted use pesticide for the purpose of 
producing any agricultural commodity on property owned or rented by the applicator or 
applicator’s employer.

HB 114/ Page 4 
 
Pesticide Application under the Supervision of a Certified Applicator 
 
 
 
Application under Supervision 
 
Statute requires that each commercial application of a pesticide be under the supervision 
of a certified pest control applicator or certified public agency applicator who is responsible 
and liable for the application. Each application of a restricted use pesticide by a certified 
private applicator must be done under the certified private applicator’s supervision, and the 
certified private applicator is responsible and liable for the application. MDA regulations 
(COMAR 15.05.02.01C) prohibit a person from using a restricted use pesticide unless the 
person is a certified applicator or is a person working under the supervision of a certified 
applicator.  
 
“Restricted use pesticide” means a pesticide classified as a restricted use pesticide by 
Title 5 of the Agriculture Article (“Pesticide Applicator’s Law”), by the Secretary of 
Agriculture, or by the federal government.  
 
“Supervision” means, unless otherwise provided by federal or State labeling, the act or 
process whereby the application of a pesticide is made by a competent person acting under 
the instructions and control of a certified applicator who is (1) responsible for actions of 
that person and (2) available when needed, though the certified applicator may not be 
physically present at the time and place the pesticide is applied.  
 
 
 
Registration and Training of Employees 
 
Each place of business engaged in the business of conducting pest control must obtain an 
annual license from MDA and each public agency that applies a pesticide must hold an 
annual permit from MDA, and MDA regulations (COMAR 15.05.01.04 and 
15.05.01.03A(3) and (4)) require those licensees and permittees to (1) annually register 
each employee that performs pest control and (2) ensure that each employee, other than a 
certified applicator, successfully completes a training program approved by MDA within 
30 days of employment and before they are registered. An employee who has not 
successfully completed the training may not perform pest control services unless a certified 
applicator or registered employee is physically present at the time and place of the pest 
control service.  
 
 
 
Certification/Registration Fees 
 
Certified pest control applicators pay an annual fee, by June 30, of $75 plus $25 for each 
category (e.g., structural, ornamental/turf, agricultural, etc.), in excess of one, in which they 
are certified. Pest control businesses pay an annual fee, by June 30, of $30 for each

registered employee. There is no fee for certification as a public agency applicator or for 
public agencies to register their employees.  
 
Fee revenues are paid into the Pesticide Fund and used for expenses of administering the 
Pesticide Applicator’s Law.  
 
 
Penalties for Violations of Pesticide Application Requirements 
 
Several penalties can apply to violations of pesticide application requirements:  (1) denial, 
suspension, or revocation of a license, permit, or certificate; (2) civil penalties (§ 5-210.2); 
and (3) criminal and indemnification penalties (§ 5-211).  
 
Cyclodiene Termiticide 
 
Statute defines “cyclodiene termiticide” to mean various specified chemical compounds 
and related chemical compounds used for the control of termites. Cyclodiene termiticide 
distributed, sold, or offered for sale in the State is classified as a restricted use pesticide. It 
may only be distributed, sold, or offered for sale to, and applied by, (1) a certified pesticide 
applicator or (2) a registered employee who has completed a course in termiticide 
application and applies the termiticide under the direct supervision of a certified pesticide 
applicator.  
 
Antifouling Paints 
 
Statute prohibits the distribution, possession, sale, offer for sale, use, or offer for use of any 
antifouling paint containing a tributyltin compound (or any substance containing a 
tributyltin compound in concentrated form that is labeled for mixing with paint by the user 
to produce an antifouling paint for use on a vessel), with the exception of (1) the 
distribution or sale of specified antifouling paint containing a tributyltin compound to the 
owner or agent of a commercial boatyard and (2) the possession and specified application 
of the paint by the owner or agent. The prohibition also does not apply to certain antifouling 
paint commonly referred to as an outboard or lower drive unit paint, in spray cans of 
16 ounces or less. “Antifouling paint” means a compound, coating, paint, or treatment 
applied or used for the purpose of controlling freshwater or marine fouling organisms on 
vessels.  
 
Background:   
 
Application of Restricted Use Pesticides 
 
MDA indicates that the bill’s provisions addressing the application of restricted use 
pesticides reflect the department’s plan, approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection 

END OF PAGE 5

HB 114/ Page 6 
Agency (EPA), to implement EPA regulations (see 40 CFR § 171.303(a)(7)) that require 
states to either (1) impose specified standards for noncertified pesticide applicators to apply 
restricted use pesticides under the direct supervision of a certified applicator (including 
annual training) or (2) not permit the use of restricted use pesticides by noncertified 
applicators. MDA’s plan adopts the second option.  
 
MDA indicates that allowing for the application of restricted use pesticides under the 
(direct) supervision of a certified private (agriculture) applicator to continue, subject to 
additional requirements, is intended to reflect a partial exemption for those applications, 
under MDA’s EPA-approved plan, from the more stringent requirements applicable to 
commercial applications. Under the federal requirements that must be complied with for 
those applications (40 C.F.R § 171.201(b)(3)), annual training is not required and “direct 
supervision” does not require the physical presence of the certified private applicator 
(unless required by product labeling) at the site of the application; however, the 
noncertified applicator must have the ability to immediately communicate with the certified 
applicator.  
 
Cyclodiene Termiticide and Antifouling Paints 
 
MDA indicates that cyclodiene termiticide and antifouling paints containing a tributyltin 
compound are no longer in use, making the provisions in State law governing them 
obsolete.  
 
State Revenues:  Special fund revenues increase by at least $140,000 annually beginning 
in fiscal 2026 due to the collection of additional fees. The estimate reflects the following 
assumptions:   
 
 
a minimum of 2,000 individuals who are registered employees of pest control 
businesses instead become certified pest control applicators under the bill, in order 
to continue applying restricted use pesticides (this reflects MDA’s estimate that 
there are at least 6,000 registered employees currently and at least one-third of those 
registered employees seek to become certified under the bill);  
 
the number of individuals who maintain certifications (under the bill) instead of 
registrations (in the absence of the bill) remains at least 2,000 in future years; 
 
those individuals, on average, become certified in at least two categories of pest 
control (based on MDA’s indication that it is common for certified pest control 
applicators to be certified in more than one category); and 
 
the fee revenue that MDA receives from each of those individuals increases in 
fiscal 2026 and future years from $30 (the annual registration fee) to $100 (the 
annual $75 fee for certification in one category plus $25 for certification in an 
additional category), a total increase in revenue per individual of $70.

HB 114/ Page 7 
State Expenditures:  MDA advises that it can handle administering the exams and any 
other additional administrative processing work related to certifying, instead of registering, 
a minimum of 2,000 individuals before the bill’s effective date of October 1, 2025.  
 
Based on responses from the Maryland Department of Transportation and the Department 
of Natural Resources, and the fact that there is no fee for public agency registered 
employees or certified public agency applicators, compliance with the bill is expected to 
be handled with existing resources by State agencies that apply pesticides.  
 
Small Business Effect:  MDA indicates that the bill has minimal impact on small 
businesses because (1) pest control businesses in the State have known about the EPA 
regulations mentioned above (under Background) and MDA’s intention to comply with the 
regulations by requiring individuals to be certified in order to apply restricted use pesticides 
for a number of years; (2) if needed, most have already increased the number of certified 
applicators on their staff; and (3) the increased cost to certify, instead of register, an 
employee is $45 per year.  
 
DLS disagrees with MDA and advises that pest control small businesses that currently use 
noncertified applicators to apply restricted use pesticides under the supervision of a 
certified pest control applicator may be meaningfully affected. The DLS estimate of the 
State fiscal impact (under State Fiscal Effect) assumes the increased cost per individual, on 
average, is $70 instead of $45 (accounting for an additional $25 fee for certification in an 
additional category), and the Maryland State Pest Control Association indicates that 
additional costs can be incurred. For example, individuals who do not have existing 
experience (one year as a full-time registered employee) or education that meet MDA’s 
requirements can incur costs of up to $300 to take an online course approved by MDA in 
order to meet the experience/education requirements. Businesses that pay these fees and 
education costs on behalf of their employees presumably could be meaningfully affected 
by the bill.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
TITLE OF BILL: 
Pesticide and Pest Control - Revisions to Pesticide Applicator’s Law 
and Repeal of Obsolete Provisions 
 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB 114 
 
PREPARED BY: 
Robert Hofstetter 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill:   
 
_X_ WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
 
        WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
PART B.  ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
Pest control businesses are currently required to have certified applicators on staff.  In 
addition, pest control businesses have known about the changes to the federal Rule since 
2017/2018.  If needed, most have already added additional certified individuals from 
within their business.  
 
To move a person from a registered employee (non-certified applicator) to a certified 
applicator the business, or applicator, would incur extra fees of $45.00/year.
