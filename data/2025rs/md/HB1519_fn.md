Department of Legislative Services 
Maryland General Assembly 
2025 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 1519 
(Delegate Chang) 
Appropriations 
Budget and Taxation 
 
Prior Authorizations of State Debt - Alterations 
 
 
This bill modifies authorizations of State debt in prior year capital budgets, generally by 
extending deadlines for expending or encumbering funds, removing matching fund 
requirements, altering the jurisdiction in which a project is located, renaming grant 
recipients, and/or altering the purpose for which funds may be used. In some cases, altering 
the purpose of grant funds merely makes minor or technical changes for how the funds may 
be used; in other cases, grant funds may be reassigned/redistributed to an entirely different 
purpose (and grantee) within the same or a different jurisdiction. The bill takes effect 
June 1, 2025. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill modifies the conditions under which State grant funds may be used. 
These changes do not materially affect State finances. 
  
Local Effect:  None, unless the grantee is a local government. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  Several prior authorizations of State debt are consolidated into an 
omnibus bill. The types of modifications to prior authorizations of State debt that have been 
consolidated into the bill are generally shown in Appendix 1, by current project name, 
jurisdiction for the current project, and the year of the initial authorization.

HB 1519/ Page 2 
Current Law:  In general, when a matching fund is required, a grantee must present 
evidence of the matching fund to the Board of Public Works within two years of the 
authorization for State debt, and the matching fund must be certified prior to the grantee’s 
expending or encumbering State funds. 
 
Chapter 153 of 2003 established a seven-year limitation on the authority to spend an 
appropriation for a capital expenditure and a seven-year limitation on the authorization for 
State debt unless otherwise provided in an enabling act. The Act applies to all debt 
authorized on or after June 1, 1997. 
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Recent Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has not been introduced within the last 
three years. 
 
Designated Cross File:  None.
