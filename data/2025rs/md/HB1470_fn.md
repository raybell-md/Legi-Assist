Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill, under provisions that apply only in Prince George’s County and 
only to real property consisting of a parcel of land of less than five acres that is not zoned 
for commercial use: 
 
 
requires DPIE, when a person has cut or cleared trees in the Critical Area in violation 
of an approved local critical area program or Critical Area Commission (CAC) 
regulations, to record a lien on the property that is the subject of the violation within 
90 days after issuing notice of the violation to the property owner; 
 
establishes that a properly recorded lien (recorded within 90 days of issuing notice 
of the violation) is required to enforce and hold a current property owner liable for 
the cutting or clearing of trees by a previous property owner or user who performed 
the act that caused the violation; and 
 
establishes that, if a lien is not recorded as required, the local jurisdiction (1) may 
pursue an enforcement action against only the previous owner or user that 
performed the act that caused the violation; (2) may not seek remedies against the 
current property owner; (3) must perform any required restoration or mitigation that 
is not performed by the previous owner or user; and (4) may enter the property that 
is the subject of the violation, in accordance with specified existing law, for 
restoration or mitigation purposes. 
 
Under uncodified provisions, the bill establishes that:   
 
 
the bill must be construed to apply retroactively and must be applied to and 
interpreted to affect a violation in Prince George’s County occurring on or before 
November 7, 2018, but only with respect to a violation imposed on a current 
property owner who in good faith purchases the property that is the subject of the 
violation after a previous property owner or user committed the act that caused the 
violation and was cited for the violation; 
 
the Prince George’s County government must vacate any administrative 
enforcement actions taken for such a violation, including the release of a lien 
recorded on the property that is the subject of the violation; and 
 
the Prince George’s County government must reimburse a current property owner 
for all costs and fees associated with any administrative enforcement actions taken 
for such a violation, including civil penalties, bonds, reforestation costs, fees for 
attorneys, engineers, foresters, and landscape architects, and any other costs and 
fees.

Current Law:   
 
Cutting or Clearing Trees in Violation of a Local Program or Commission Regulations 
 
If a person cuts or clears, or plans to cut or clear, trees within the Critical Area in violation 
of an approved local critical area program or regulations adopted by CAC, the CAC chair 
may bring an action, or the local jurisdiction may bring an action or request that the chair 
refer the matter to the Attorney General to bring an action:   
 
 
to require the person to replant trees where the cutting or clearing occurred, in 
accordance with a plan prepared by the State Forester, a registered professional 
forester, or a registered landscape architect; 
 
to restrain the planned violation; or 
 
for damages, assessed by a circuit court in an amount equal to the estimated cost of 
replanting trees and paid to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). 
 
The Prince George’s County Code requires DPIE to enforce the provisions of the county’s 
critical area program. 
 
Critical Area Program, In General 
 
Chapter 794 of 1984 established the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program 
(now the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program) to 
minimize damage to water quality and wildlife habitat by fostering more sensitive 
development activity along the shoreline areas of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 
The goals of the program now are applicable to both the Chesapeake Bay and the 
Atlantic Coastal Bays and include (1) protection of water quality; (2) conservation of 
habitat; (3) accommodation of future growth and development without adverse 
environmental impacts; (4) improvement of climate resiliency; and (5) equitable 
distribution of the burdens and benefits of development, mitigation, restoration, 
conservation, and climate change adaptation within the Critical Area. 
 
Chapter 794 identified the Critical Area as all land within 1,000 feet of the mean high water 
line of tidal waters or the landward edge of tidal wetlands and all waters of and lands under 
the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. In 2002, the Critical Area was expanded to include 
the State’s coastal bays, and, in 2024, the program was modified to incorporate climate 
resilience, environmental justice, and equity measures. The 1984 legislation also created 
CAC within DNR, which oversees the development and implementation of local land use 
programs dealing with the Critical Area. Each local jurisdiction is charged with the primary 
responsibility for development and implementation of its own local program; that local 
authority, however, is subject to commission review and approval and must be consistent 
with the commission’s regulations.

Local Expenditures:  Prince George’s County expenditures are expected to increase by 
approximately $40,000 in fiscal 2026 only, to, as required under the uncodified provisions 
of the bill, reimburse a current property owner for all costs and fees associated with 
specified administrative enforcement actions taken for a previous owner’s violation. 
 
This estimate is based on available information indicating that the bill’s uncodified 
provisions appear to apply to only one property and that the property owners, as of 
March 2025, had incurred costs totaling close to $40,000 associated with administrative 
enforcement actions relating to the previous owner’s cutting or clearing of trees. 
 
The estimate assumes: 
 
 
additional costs are not incurred by the property owners between March 2025 and 
the bill’s October 1, 2025 effective date; 
 
beginning on the bill’s effective date, for future relevant enforcement actions, DPIE, 
as required by the bill, records a lien on any property that is the subject of a violation, 
within 90 days after issuing notice of the violation to the property owner and, 
therefore, is not responsible for any required restoration or mitigation not performed 
by a previous owner or user; and 
 
with respect to the bill’s retroactive application, the county is also not required to 
perform any required restoration or mitigation that is not performed by the previous 
owner or user, since the condition for that responsibility is that a lien is not recorded 
as required (under the bill), and there is no recordation requirement prior to the 
bill’s effective date (and there was not a recordation requirement at the time of a 
violation on or before November 7, 2018).
