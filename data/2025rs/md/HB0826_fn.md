HB 826/ Page 2 
 
develop accountability measures for procurement forecasts, strategic plans, 
procurement review group processes, and liaison officer accountability;  
 
work with the Office of State Procurement to implement process improvements that 
directly impact socioeconomic procurement businesses’ ability to fairly compete for 
and understand State contracting opportunities;  
 
identify and recommend statutory and regulatory reforms to strengthen and improve 
the State’s socioeconomic procurement programs; and  
 
recommend actions to make improvements to the Small Business Reserve Program, 
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) Program, and Veteran Small Business 
Enterprise Program.  
 
On or before December 31, 2025, and each December 1 thereafter, the Subcabinet must 
report to the Governor on its activities, progress, and recommendations. 
 
Current Law:  The Interdepartmental Advisory Committee on Small, Minority, and 
Women Business Affairs is composed of (1) the secretary of each principal department of 
the Executive Branch of government, or their designee; (2) the State Superintendent of 
Schools, or designee; (3) the Secretary of Higher Education, or designee; and (4) the 
Special Secretary for the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs. The 
committee must (1) advise the Special Secretary for the Office of Small, Minority, and 
Women Business Affairs on proposals to implement and enhance the duties of GOSBA, 
including the promotion of employment of minority persons in the State, and the promotion 
of the growth and participation of MBEs in the State; (2) gather such information that the 
committee deems necessary to promote GOSBA’s goals; (3) provide other assistance that 
may be required to further the purposes of GOSBA and support MBEs; and (4) meet at the 
call of the Special Secretary for the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business 
Affairs.  
 
Background:  The functions of the Interdepartmental Advisory Committee on Small, 
Minority, and Women Business Affairs began in 1986, when the Interdepartmental 
Advisory Committee for Minority Affairs was established within the Governor’s Office of 
Minority Affairs. In June 2017, the Office was renamed the Governor’s Office of Small, 
Minority, and Women Business Affairs, and the Committee was renamed the 
Interdepartmental Advisory Committee on Small Minority, and Women Business Affairs. 
Since that time, GOSBA has not received any indication that the legislative body has 
convened. Due to the lack of activity, GOSBA proposes to repeal the committee. In its 
place, GOSBA plans to establish a new committee to advise on initiatives to enhance the 
office’s responsibilities and promote the growth and participation of MBEs, veteran-owned 
small business enterprises, and small and minority-owned businesses in the State.
