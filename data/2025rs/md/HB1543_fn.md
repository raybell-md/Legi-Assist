(Delegate Stein) 
Ways and Means

Gaming - Sports Wagering Facilities - Request for Relocation 
 
 
This bill authorizes competitively awarded Class B-1 and B-2 sports wagering facility 
licensees to submit a written request to the State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission 
(SLGCC) to relocate a Class B sports wagering facility. SLGCC may grant a relocation 
request if the licensee was originally issued a Class B sports wagering facility license 
before October 1, 2023, and the new location for the sports wagering facility is within the 
same county, complies with specified location requirements, and is approved by the Sports 
Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC). The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill does not materially affect State revenues. The State Lottery and 
Gaming Control Agency and SWARC can approve any relocation requests with existing 
resources. 
  
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 492 of 2020, a constitutional amendment approved by the voters 
at the November 2020 general election, authorized sports and event wagering, contingent 
upon implementation legislation passed by the General Assembly. Chapter 356 of 2021 
implemented sports wagering in the State and provides for regulation of sports wagering 
and fantasy gaming competitions. Licensees receive 85% of proceeds from sports wagering 
and fantasy gaming and the State receives 15%, as well as license fee revenues. Any 
winnings on a sports event not claimed within 182 days after the wager is won revert to the 
Problem Gambling Fund.

HB 1543/ Page 2 
Sports wagering licenses are awarded by SWARC, the members of which were appointed 
by the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House. SWARC must 
review applications for sports wagering facility and mobile sports wagering licensure, and 
SLGCC and the Department of Legislative Services must staff SWARC. SWARC 
terminates on January 1, 2028, but the Governor may reconstitute SWARC under specified 
circumstances. 
 
Specified Class A (casinos, professional sports stadiums, and horse racing licensees) and 
Class B (specified horse racing tracks, off-track facilities, and specified bingo halls) sports 
wagering facility licensees designated under the law are eligible to receive licenses under 
a noncompetitive process. SWARC may also conduct a competitive process to award an 
additional 30 Class B-1 or B-2 facility licenses and 60 mobile sports wagering licenses. 
SWARC may not award a Class B sports wagering facility license to an applicant who is 
eligible for or holds a Class A sports wagering facility license. 
 
Generally, SWARC may not award a Class B-1 or B-2 sports wagering facility license to 
an applicant whose sports wagering facility will be located: 
 
 
within a 15-mile radius of a Class A-1 or A-2 sports wagering facility located in 
Allegany, Cecil, or Worcester counties; 
 
with respect to an application for a sports wagering facility license submitted before 
June 1, 2025, within a 15-mile radius of specified Class B-1 or B-2 sports wagering 
facilities in Charles County; 
 
with respect to an application for a sports wagering facility license submitted before 
June 1, 2025, within a 10-mile radius of specified Class B-1 or B-2 sports wagering 
facilities in Carroll County; 
 
with respect to an application for a sports wagering facility license submitted before 
June 1, 2025, within a 5-mile radius of specified Class B-1 or B-2 sports wagering 
facilities in Frederick County; 
 
within a 1.5-mile radius of a Class A-1 or A-2 sports wagering facility located in 
counties other than Allegany, Cecil, or Worcester counties; or 
 
within a 1.5-mile radius of any other Class B-1 or B-2 sports wagering facility. 
 
Chapter 638 of 2023 authorized SLGCC and SWARC to consider a request to amend a 
Class B-2 sports wagering facility license application for the purpose of altering the 
proposed location of the facility if a sports wagering facility license was awarded to the 
applicant by February 15, 2023, and a written request to amend the application was 
received by December 31, 2023.
