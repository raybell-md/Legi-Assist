Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Timing of Special Elections to Fill a Vacancy in a County Council or in the Office of Chief 
Executive Officer or County Executive 
 
The bill modifies a provision governing the timing of a special election to fill a vacancy in 
a county council or in the office of chief executive officer or county executive (if the charter 
of that county provides for special elections) which, under existing law, requires that there 
be at least 45 days between the date an absentee ballot is made available to an absent 
uniformed services voter or an overseas voter and the date of the special election. The bill 
modifies that provision by also requiring that the date of a special election (1) be at least 
90 days after the adoption of the resolution of the county council establishing the date of 
the special election and (2) not be within 120 days of a regularly scheduled election. 
 
Conflict of Laws Relating to the Conduct of a Special Election 
 
If the State Administrator of Elections determines that a conflict exists between a county 
charter or other county law relating to the conduct of a special election and the provisions 
of the Election Law Article or COMAR, the State Administrator must conduct the special 
election entirely in accordance with the Election Law Article and COMAR. 
 
Special Elections Conducted by Mail 
 
The bill establishes that, for a special election conducted by mail, a local board of elections 
is not required to mail specimen ballots to the registered voters who are eligible to vote in 
the special election. 
 
The bill also (1) changes the date – from at least 14 days, to at least 30 days, before the day 
of a special election – by which a local board must send a vote-by-mail ballot to each 
eligible voter and (2) establishes that a voter may return a vote-by-mail ballot to a local 
board of elections through a ballot drop box. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Timing of Special Elections to Fill a Vacancy in a County Council or in the Office of Chief 
Executive Officer or County Executive 
 
A special primary election and a special general election may be held at a time other than 
the date of a regular primary election and a regular general election to fill a vacancy in a

county council or in the office of chief executive officer or county executive if the charter 
of that county provides for special elections. 
 
Special elections to fill vacancies in a county council or in the office of chief executive 
officer or county executive must be held as provided in the county charter. The date set for 
a special election must allow at least 45 days between the date an absentee ballot is made 
available to an absent uniformed services voter or an overseas voter and the date of the 
special election. 
 
Special Elections Conducted by Mail 
 
Statute generally authorizes special elections that are not held concurrently with a regularly 
scheduled primary or general election to be conducted by mail. A local special election 
must be conducted by mail if the resolution of the county council or board of county 
commissioners establishing the date of the special election directs that the election be 
conducted by mail. 
 
In a special election conducted by mail, a vote-by-mail ballot is mailed to each registered 
voter who is eligible to vote in the special election, unless the voter has requested that the 
ballot be sent by other means. A local board must send a vote-by-mail ballot to each eligible 
voter at least 14 days before the day of a special election. 
 
A local board of elections must establish at least one in-person voting center for the use of 
any eligible voter, which must be open for voting each day beginning six days before the 
day of a special election through the day of the special election; however, separate  
in-person voting center provisions apply in Montgomery County. 
 
A voter may return a vote-by-mail ballot to a local board (1) by mail; (2) in person during 
regular office hours; or (3) through a duly authorized agent. A ballot is considered timely 
and may be counted if the ballot is returned in person to the office of a local board by 
8:00 p.m. on the day of the special election or (1) is received by mail by a local board by 
10:00 a.m. on the second Friday after the special election and (2) was mailed by 
election day. 
 
Background:  SBE indicates that the bill’s changes are needed to ensure that special 
elections do not interfere with the administration of regular elections and to ensure that 
voters are given sufficient time to vote in special elections. 
 
The most recent special elections were held in Prince George’s County:  (1) a countywide 
special primary election (conducted by mail) on August 6, 2024; (2) a special general 
election on November 5, 2024, (during the presidential general election); and (3) another

HB 75/ Page 4 
countywide special primary election (conducted by mail) on March 4, 2025. A countywide 
special general election (conducted by mail) is scheduled for June 3, 2025.  
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The bill is not expected to have a direct effect on local government 
finances; however, the bill significantly limits when special elections can be held 
independent of regularly scheduled elections (see Additional Comments below) and may 
indirectly affect the number of special elections a county holds that are independent of 
regularly scheduled elections (and, consequently, the extent to which the county incurs the 
increased costs associated with holding special elections independent of regularly 
scheduled elections). 
 
For illustrative purposes:   
 
 
If the bill had been in effect in 2024 (hypothetically), Prince George’s County would 
not have been able to hold the August 6, 2024, special primary election since it 
would have been within 90 days of the adoption of the resolution establishing the 
date of the election (adopted in late June 2024) and within 120 days of both the 
regularly scheduled primary election on May 14, 2024, and the regularly scheduled 
general election on November 5, 2024. This presumably would have required the 
county to wait to hold both the special primary and special general elections until 
120 days after the November 5, 2024, election (March 2025), and to pay the 
increased costs of holding a special election independent of a regularly scheduled 
election for both the special primary election and special general election (instead 
of only paying the increased costs for the special primary election and holding the 
special general election during the regularly scheduled general election, as the 
county did in 2024). 
 
 
Alternatively, if instead a vacancy occurs at least 90 days prior to a regularly 
scheduled presidential primary election, and the bill’s 120-day prohibition is 
interpreted to allow for a special primary and special general election to be held 
during a regularly scheduled primary and general election (as described below under 
Additional Comments), a county’s costs may be reduced if the special primary and 
general elections are held during the regularly scheduled presidential primary and 
general elections when the county otherwise would have held one or both of the 
special primary and general elections independent of a regularly scheduled election.

HB 75/ Page 5 
For context regarding the costs of a special election held independent of a regularly 
scheduled election:   
 
 
Prince George’s County spent $2.1 million on its August 2024 special primary 
election conducted by mail (a countywide election, for which there were 
489,053 eligible registered voters), the most significant costs of which were 
$791,381 for the mailing and return of vote-by-mail ballots and $768,150 for 
election judges to staff nine voting centers for seven days; and 
 
 
assuming the county’s special election costs are largely proportional to the size of 
the electorate, a special primary election held in a single councilmanic district (of 
which there are nine in the county) results in county expenditures of at least  
one-ninth of the costs for the August 2024 special primary election, or $235,156. 
 
Additional Comments:  If the bill’s prohibition on setting the date of a special election 
within 120 days of a regularly scheduled election is interpreted to apply to both the 
120 days before a regularly scheduled election and after the election, the bill prohibits 
holding a special election during a period greater than one year surrounding regularly 
scheduled elections. During a presidential election year, for example, under the bill, a 
special election cannot be held during the period beginning in late December of the year 
before the presidential election year (120 days before the regularly scheduled primary 
election on the fourth Tuesday in April of the presidential election year) and ending in early 
March of the year after the presidential election year (120 days after the regularly scheduled 
general election on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November of the presidential 
election year). Every date within that approximately 14-month period is within 120 days 
of a regularly scheduled election.  
 
However, if the bill’s 120-day prohibition is interpreted to not prohibit a special election 
from being held during a regularly scheduled election (provided the resolution establishing 
the date of the special election is adopted at least 90 days before the date of the regularly 
scheduled primary election) the special primary and general elections could be held during 
the regularly scheduled presidential primary and general elections.
