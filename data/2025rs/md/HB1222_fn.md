This bill requires (1) a federal law enforcement officer to notify specified individuals 
regarding a federal immigration enforcement action at a “sensitive location”; (2) a public 
school, a public library, or a unit of the Executive Branch of State or local government that 
operates at a sensitive location to deny access to any portion of the sensitive location that

immigration law, unless the individual presents a valid judicial warrant or exigent 
circumstances exist (without application to a State or local correctional facility or a 
detention facility in a District Court or circuit court house); (3) the Attorney General to 
develop and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant State agencies regarding 
immigration enforcement at sensitive locations, as specified; and (4) by October 1, 2025,

General Assembly. The bill takes effect June 1, 2025.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Attorney General Guidance:  The Attorney General must develop and publish guidance 
that informs the public and relevant State agencies about:   
 
 
delineating between immigration enforcement within the public portions of 
sensitive locations and the nonpublic or private portions of sensitive locations; 
 
verifying the identity of immigration enforcement agents and validating 
immigration enforcement documentation seeking specific individuals; 
 
limiting liability exposure for State, local, and private institutions and the 
participation of the employees of those institutions in immigration enforcement at 
sensitive locations; 
 
facilitating relationships between federal law enforcement officers and State and 
local officials and law enforcement officers in order to conduct immigration 
enforcement activities through the least dangerous and disruptive means; and 
 
complying with existing legal obligations and limitations on State and local agencies 
while maintaining public safety and accessibility to those agencies. 
 
Private entities are encouraged to adopt policies consistent with the guidance developed by 
the Attorney General if the private entities provide services related to (1) physical or mental 
health; (2) education; (3) shelter care; or (4) access to justice. 
 
The required guidance and policies are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act 
under Title 10, Subtitles 1, 2, and 3 of the State Government Article.  
 
Governmental Entity Procedures:  The procedures required to be developed and published 
by governmental entities that prevent the sale and redisclosure of personal records and 
geolocation data provided or made available by the governmental entity in a way that harms 
the privacy of residents of the State must address:   
 
 
any possible contractual limitations on the sale or redisclosure of personal records 
or geolocation data that a governmental entity may place on a person who receives 
personal records or geolocation data that are provided or made available by the 
governmental entity;

HB 1222/ Page 3 
 
considerations regarding (1) the threat to privacy posed by data brokers who utilize 
personal records or geolocation data for commercial purposes; (2) the risk that 
personal records or geolocation data may be used for purposes other than the 
purposes for which the personal records or geolocation data were developed or 
collected; and (3) geolocation, genetic, and other sensitive data; and  
 
any other considerations necessary to (1) protect the privacy of residents of the 
State; (2) discourage the development of a secondary commercial market for 
personal records or geolocation data that are provided or made available by a 
governmental entity; (3) and limit a person who receives personal records or 
geolocation data that are provided or made available by a governmental entity from 
selling or redisclosing the data with other persons. 
 
Definitions:  “Sensitive location” means:   
 
 
a public school; 
 
a public library; 
 
a health care facility operated by a unit of State or local government; 
 
a facility operated by the Comptroller; 
 
a courthouse; or 
 
any other location that (1) provides State-funded services related to physical or 
mental health, education, shelter care, or access to justice and (2) as determined by 
the Attorney General, requires special consideration for immigration enforcement 
activities. 
 
“Collateral immigration enforcement” means federal immigration enforcement actions that 
affect individuals who are not the primary target of the enforcement action but are present 
at the location of the enforcement action. 
 
“Immigration enforcement” means federal immigration enforcement actions. 
 
Current Law:  While immigration is controlled by federal law, the U.S. Immigration, 
Customs, and Enforcement Division (ICE) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
have initiated numerous programs that involve state and local law enforcement agencies as 
allies and additional resources. For example, the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) supports 
ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in executing its mission through the arrest and 
removal of undocumented immigrants who threaten the safety of the nation’s communities 
and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws. CAP focuses on the identification, arrest, and 
removal of incarcerated undocumented immigrants at federal, state, and local levels, as 
well as at-large criminal undocumented immigrants.

HB 1222/ Page 4 
Federal law does not mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies become 
involved in immigration efforts. However, federal law does prohibit a state or local 
government from prohibiting or in any way restricting any government entity or official 
from sending to or receiving from ICE information regarding the citizenship or 
immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual. It also prohibits restrictions on 
any of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful 
or unlawful, of any individual:  (1) sending such information to, or requesting or receiving 
such information from, ICE; (2) maintaining such information; or (3) exchanging such 
information with any other federal, state, or local government authority. 
 
Responding to Immigration Detainers 
 
The Office of the Attorney General of Maryland issued a guidance memorandum in 
January 2025 (updated April 2025) pertaining to local enforcement of federal immigration 
law and includes guidance on immigration detainers. Such detainers are notices sent from 
ICE to state or local law enforcement agencies that request the agency to continue to hold 
the individual named in the detainer for up to 48 hours past the date that the individual is 
otherwise eligible for release. The memorandum notes that immigration detainers are 
requests only and local officers are not obligated to honor them and may risk violating 
constitutional rights by doing so. A law enforcement agency’s decision to comply with a 
detainer request and hold an individual beyond the individual’s normal release date 
constitutes a new “seizure.” That new seizure must be justified under the 
Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the analogous provisions of Article 26 of 
the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Attorney General specifically notes that the 
requirements of the Fourth Amendment do not change because ICE has issued a detainer 
request to a law enforcement agency. 
 
Database Access 
 
Chapter 18 of the 2021 special session modified Maryland’s Public Information Act (PIA) 
to require an officer, an employee, an agent, or a contractor of the State or a political 
subdivision to deny inspection of specified records, and deny inspection using facial 
recognition searches, by any federal agency seeking access for the purpose of enforcing 
federal immigration law unless provided with a valid warrant. In addition, a person who 
receives specified personal information under PIA may not disclose the information to a 
federal agent or federal agency for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement unless 
presented with a valid warrant. The Motor Vehicle Administration, the Department of State 
Police, and the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services must submit a 
specified annual report to the General Assembly on records requests from federal agencies 
seeking access for immigration enforcement purposes. In addition, State and local 
law enforcement agencies and other specified entities that operate a specified database 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 1222/ Page 5 
must deny access to the database to an individual seeking access for the purpose of 
enforcing federal immigration law, unless provided with a valid warrant. 
 
Immigration Status and Law Enforcement Agents 
 
Chapter 19 further prohibits a law enforcement agent, during the performance of regular 
police functions from (1) inquiring about an individual’s citizenship, immigration status, 
or place of birth during a stop, a search, or an arrest; (2) detaining, or prolonging the 
detention of an individual for the purpose of investigating the individual’s citizenship or 
immigration status, or based on the suspicion that the individual has committed a civil 
immigration violation; (3) transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities 
unless required by federal law; or (4) coercing, intimidating, or threatening any individual 
based on the actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status of the individual or 
specified individuals that are generally related to the individual. 
 
Nothing in the provisions prevent a law enforcement agent from inquiring about any 
information that is material to a criminal investigation. 
 
If the citizenship or immigration status of an individual is relevant to a protection accorded 
to the individual under State or federal law, or subject to a requirement imposed by 
international treaty, a law enforcement agent may (1) notify the individual of the protection 
or requirement and (2) provide the individual an opportunity to voluntarily disclose the 
individual’s citizenship or immigration status for the purpose of receiving the protection or 
complying with the requirement. 
 
“Civil immigration violation” means a violation of federal civil immigration law. 
 
“Law enforcement agent” means an individual who is certified by the Maryland Police 
Training and Standards Commission. “Law enforcement agent” does not include an agent 
or employee of a State correctional facility or local correctional facility. “Arrest” does not 
include a routine booking procedure.
