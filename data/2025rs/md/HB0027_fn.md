Estates and Trusts - Compensation of Guardians of Property and Trustees 
 
 
This bill repeals specific rates (and sources of payment) established in statute for trustee 
commissions in instances where (1) the trustee compensation amount and source of 
payment is not established by the trust or any valid agreement and (2) the trustee is not a 
financial institution or Maryland attorney that is authorized to charge certain increased 
compensation rates. The bill instead establishes that, in such instances, a trustee is entitled 
to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances, distributed evenly from trust 
income and principal, and establishes various factors for a court to consider in determining 
whether a trustee’s compensation is reasonable. The bill preserves the application of the 
existing specific rates (and sources of payment) to the compensation of a guardian of the 
property of a minor or a disabled person.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General fund (income tax) revenues may be affected to the extent the bill 
shifts trust income or principal to trustees’ personal or business income through increased 
trustee compensation. The extent of any impact cannot be reliably estimated and appears 
likely to be limited. Expenditures are not materially affected.  
  
Local Effect:  None.  
 
Small Business Effect:  Potential meaningful.

Bill Summary:   
 
Specific Commission Rates Replaced with “Reasonable Compensation” 
 
The bill repeals existing provisions governing commissions paid to trustees if the trust, or 
the provisions of any valid agreement, does not establish the amount and source of payment 
of commissions. The repealed provisions establish commissions, at specific rates, on 
(1) the trust’s income; (2) the value of the corpus (or principal) held in trust at the end of 
each year; (3) sales of real or leasehold property; and (4) the value of the corpus distributed 
upon final distribution of a trust estate or portion of a trust estate. Under the repealed 
provisions, a court may increase or diminish commissions for sufficient cause or allow 
special commissions or compensation for services of an unusual nature.  
 
In place of the repealed provisions, the bill establishes that (1) a trustee is entitled to 
compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances if the terms of a trust do not 
specify a trustee’s compensation and (2) the trustee must also be allowed reasonable 
compensation for other services rendered in connection with the administration of the trust.  
 
If the terms of a trust specify a trustee’s compensation, the bill establishes circumstances 
in which a court may authorize more or less compensation:  (1) if the duties of the trustee 
are substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was first created; or (2) if 
the compensation specified by the terms of the trust would be unreasonably low or high.  
 
Financial Institutions and Maryland Attorneys Serving as Trustee 
 
Existing provisions that allow a financial institution whose activities are subject to State or 
federal supervision, or a member of the Maryland Bar, to charge reasonable compensation 
in accordance with a schedule of increased rates instead of the income commission and 
annual corpus commission rates established for other trustees are largely unchanged by the 
bill; however, the bill does remove references to those rates being “increased” rates in 
comparison to the commissions/compensation of other trustees. Under the bill, those 
provisions allowing for reasonable compensation (rephrased by the bill as “compensation 
that is reasonable under the circumstances”) in accordance with a schedule of rates cover 
the entirety of the trustee’s compensation as a result of the bill’s repeal of provisions 
establishing specific commission rates for property sales and final distribution of trust 
corpus.

HB 27/ Page 3 
Determining Reasonable Compensation 
 
In determining whether a trustee’s compensation is reasonable, the bill establishes that a 
court must consider:   
 
 
the value and character of the trust property;  
 
the risk and responsibility of administering the trust property;  
 
the time spent on and the quality and character of the services provided by the 
trustee;  
 
the character and cost of services provided by others;  
 
the trustee’s skill and experience;  
 
the results obtained by the trustee;  
 
the terms of the trust; and 
 
any other factor the court considers relevant.  
 
Allocation of Compensation among Trust Principal and Income 
 
With the bill repealing provisions that establish trustee commission rates that are based on, 
and drawn from, the trust’s income and the trust corpus (or principal), the bill establishes 
provisions that instead require one-half of the regular compensation of a trustee, and of any 
person providing investment advisory or custodial services to the trustee, to be distributed 
from trust income and the remaining one-half to be distributed from trust principal.  
 
Specific Commission Rates for a Guardian of the Property Preserved 
 
The bill preserves the application of the specific commission rates (applicable to both 
trustees and a guardian of the property of a minor or a disabled person under current law) 
to a guardian of the property.  
 
Current Law:   
 
Specific Commission Rates 
 
Unless otherwise specified in the terms of a trust or the provisions of any valid agreement, 
trustees are entitled to the following commissions:   
 
 
Income Commissions (Paid from Trust Income) – accounting from July 1, 1981, 
(1) 6% on income from real estate, ground rents, and mortgages collected in each 
year and (2) 6.5% on the first $10,000 of all other income collected in each year, 
5% on the next $10,000, 4% on the next $10,000, and 3% on any remainder;

HB 27/ Page 4 
 
Annual Corpus Commissions (Paid from Trust Corpus) – accounting from 
July 1, 1981, (1) 0.4% on the first $250,000 of the fair value of the trust corpus at 
the end of each year; (2) 0.25% on the next $250,000; (3) 0.15% on the next 
$500,000; and (4) 0.1% on any excess;  
 
Commission for Sale of Real or Leasehold Property (Paid from the Proceeds of the 
Sale) – the rate allowed by rule of court or statute to trustees appointed to make sales 
under circuit court decrees or orders; and 
 
Commission for Final Distribution of a Trust Estate (or Portion Thereof) – 0.5% of 
the fair value of the distributed corpus, subject to revision or determination by a 
circuit court under special circumstances.  
 
A court with jurisdiction over the administration of the trust may increase or diminish 
commissions for sufficient cause or may allow special commissions or compensation for 
services of an unusual nature.  
 
Increased Rates for Financial Institutions and Maryland Attorneys Serving as Trustee 
 
A financial institution whose activities are subject to State or federal supervision, or a 
member of the Maryland Bar, may charge reasonable compensation in accordance with a 
schedule of increased rates instead of the rates for income commissions and annual corpus 
commissions established in statute, provided that notice of the increased rates is given to 
the qualified beneficiaries of the trust.  
 
Allocation of Commissions/Compensation among Trust Principal and Income 
 
Statute establishes that, aside from income and annual corpus commissions paid at the rates 
established in statute (which are paid from income and corpus, respectively), the trustee 
must allocate compensation of the trustee, and compensation of any person providing 
investment advisory or custodial services to the trustee, among principal and income as the 
trustee determines is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries.  
 
Specific Commission Rates Also Applicable to a Guardian of the Property 
 
A guardian of the property can be appointed by a court to manage the property of a minor 
or a disabled person under certain circumstances. A guardian of the property is entitled to 
the same compensation and reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses as the trustee 
of a trust except in unusual circumstances (in which the court may increase or decrease 
compensation) or if the disabled person is a recipient of long-term care services and 
supports under Medicaid (in which case a $50 maximum limit on monthly compensation 
applies unless a court finds unusual circumstances exist).

State Revenues:  General fund (income tax) revenues may be affected to the extent the 
bill shifts trust income or principal to trustees’ personal or business income through 
increased compensation of trustees. The extent of any impact cannot be reliably estimated 
and appears likely to be limited. The bill is expected to have a material impact only in 
circumstances in which (1) the terms of a trust do not set trustee compensation amounts; 
(2) the trustee is not a financial institution or Maryland attorney; and (3) there is a material 
difference between the amount of tax paid when the increased compensation is taxed as 
part of the trustee’s personal or business income in comparison to the amount of tax that 
would be paid if an equivalent amount was taxed as part of the trust’s income.  
 
Small Business Effect:  Small businesses that serve as trustees may meaningfully benefit 
from the bill through increased compensation.  
 
Additional Comments:  The Department of Legislative Services notes that the bill’s 
modifications to statute to preserve the application of the existing, specific commission 
rates for a guardian of the property appear to inadvertently limit – under § 13-218(a)(1) of 
the Estates and Trusts Article – the ability of a guardian of the property to be reimbursed 
for actual and necessary expenses. Since this appears to be inadvertent, it is not reflected 
in the Bill Summary.
