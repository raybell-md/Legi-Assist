Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 128 of 2014 authorizes the Comptroller to monitor and record 
incoming telephone calls to employees of the Comptroller’s call centers, to telephones 
within the offices of the Comptroller, for training, quality control, and employee safety 
purposes. Monitored or recorded telephone calls must contain a notice to the telephone 
caller that “your call may be recorded or monitored for training and quality control 
purposes.” The Comptroller may only record or monitor incoming calls to the automated 
call distribution system and is prohibited from recording or monitoring calls to or from 
direct individual lines in the Office of the Comptroller.

HB 617/ Page 2 
Chapter 128 prohibits information derived from an incoming telephone call to employees 
of the Comptroller’s call centers from being used in any criminal or civil proceeding 
against any Maryland taxpayer unless the caller has made a personal and imminent threat 
against an employee or property of the State. Recorded telephone calls may not be retained 
by the Comptroller’s Office for longer than 60 days, except (1) if the call is to be used 
solely as a positive example to follow in the training of employees using the Comptroller’s 
call centers or (2) if the caller has made a personal and imminent threat against an employee 
or property of the State. 
 
Background:  The Comptroller’s Office advises that current law references a specific type 
of call distribution software that is common in call centers. However, since Chapter 128 
was first enacted, call center technology has evolved significantly, adding tools such as 
interactive voice response and ordered management systems. 
 
The bill removes outdated references to automated call distribution systems and clarifies 
that the provision only applies to calls to the Comptroller’s call centers. This change keeps 
the original intent of the law while allowing for future changes.
