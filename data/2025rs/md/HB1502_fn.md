Bill Summary:   
 
Program Requirements 
 
The bill specifies that the program must distribute syringes and provide for the exchange 
of used hypodermic needles and syringes for sterile hypodermic needles and syringes for 
participants as needed. The program must also: 
 
 
be designed and maintained to provide security measures and processes required to 
safely distribute hypodermic needles and syringes and account for the number of 
hypodermic needles and syringes exchanged and distributed by BCHD and the 
number of hypodermic needles and syringes in storage; 
 
be operated to allow participants to exchange used hypodermic needles and syringes 
at available mobile syringe services sites; 
 
include adequate staff training in providing community service provider referrals; 
and 
 
educate injecting drug users on the risk of transmitting HIV or the hepatitis B virus 
through high-risk needle-sharing practices and sexual behaviors. 
 
The bill also repeals the requirement to establish a method of identification and 
authorization for program staff members who have access to hypodermic needles, syringes, 
or program records. 
 
Oversight Committee and Program Director 
 
The composition and appointment of oversight committee representatives is altered as 
follows:   
 
 
the number of representatives from academia who specialize in public health is 
reduced from two to one; 
 
the requirement for the law enforcement representative to be nominated by the 
Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services is repealed; 
 
the representative of the Baltimore City Police Department (BCPD) is removed; 
 
the two representatives from the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), the 
Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), or the Maryland State Department of 
Education (MSDE) are reduced to just one representative from MDH, who no longer 
must be nominated by the Secretary of Health; and 
 
rather than the Mayor of Baltimore City determining up to three other individuals 
for the committee, BCHD makes the selection.

HB 1502/ Page 3 
The oversight committee’s current responsibilities are clarified to include providing advice 
to the Commissioner of Health and the program director on developing and revising as 
necessary (1) program operating procedures for the distribution and exchange of 
hypodermic needles and syringes to injecting drug users; (2) a plan for community outreach 
and education; (3) a protocol for providing referrals for program participants to addiction 
treatment and rehabilitation; and (4) a plan for evaluating the program. 
 
With advice of the oversight committee (rather than their advice and approval under 
current law), the director must develop and revise as necessary (1) program operating 
procedures for the distribution and exchange of hypodermic needles and syringes to 
injecting drug users; (2) a community outreach and education program; and (3) a protocol 
for providing referrals for program participants to substance abuse treatment and 
rehabilitation. The director must submit the operating procedures, community outreach and 
education program plan, and the addiction treatment referral protocol to the Commissioner 
of Health or the commissioner’s designee for approval prior to the implementation of 
revised procedures. 
 
Data Collection 
 
The bill repeals the requirement to collect data on the occupation of program participants, 
as well as the types of drugs used, length of drug use, and frequency of injection. The 
program must collect data on the number of participants referred to addiction treatment 
(rather than those entering drug counseling and treatment) and the number of referrals made 
by the program for addiction treatment for people who inject drugs. 
 
Program Evaluation 
 
With advice of the oversight committee (rather than their advice and approval under current 
law), BCHD must develop and implement a plan for program evaluation. The plan must 
include the estimated prevalence and incidence of HIV among program participants. The 
bill repeals the requirement to include (1) changes in the level of drug use, needle-sharing, 
and condom use among program participants; (2) the status of treatment and recovery for 
program participants who entered drug treatment programs; (3) the impact of the program 
on risk behaviors for the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and other life-threatening 
bloodborne diseases among injecting drug users; and (4) the cost-effectiveness of the 
program versus the direct and indirect costs of HIV infection in terms of medical treatment 
and other services normally required by HIV-infected individuals. 
 
The bill repeals the requirement for BCHD to develop and implement a methodology 
(1) for identifying program hypodermic needles and syringes and (2) to perform HIV 
antibody testing on the residue left in a sample of hypodermic needles and syringes 
returned to the program. BCHD must instead collect returned needles and syringes and

send them to the Rapid Analysis of Drugs Program operated by the Center for Harm 
Reduction at MDH.  
 
Current Law:  Chapter 360 of 1994 established the AIDS Prevention Sterile Needle and 
Syringe Exchange Pilot Program in BCHD. Initially scheduled to terminate in 1997, 
Chapters 177 and 178 of 1997 repealed the termination date and continued an annual 
reporting requirement. 
 
The program must: 
 
 
provide for the exchange by participants of used hypodermic needles and syringes 
for sterile hypodermic needles and syringes; 
 
operate in accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner of Health 
and the advice and approval of the oversight committee; 
 
be designed to provide maximum security of exchange locations and equipment, 
including safety measures that may be required to control the use and dispersal of 
hypodermic needles and syringes and security measures that allow for a full 
accounting of the number of hypodermic needles and syringes in circulation and the 
number in storage; 
 
be operated to allow participants to exchange used hypodermic needles and syringes 
at any exchange location, if more than one location is available; 
 
include appropriate levels of staff expertise in working with injecting drug users and 
adequate staff training in providing community referrals, counseling, and 
preventative education; 
 
provide for the dissemination of other preventative means for curtailing the spread 
of the HIV infection; 
 
provide a linkage for referrals to drug counseling and treatment services, and  
follow-up on the referrals to assure participants receive their desired treatment; 
 
educate injecting drug users on the dangers of contracting HIV or hepatitis B 
through needle-sharing practices and unsafe sexual behaviors; 
 
include policies and procedures for the screening of applicants to the program in 
order to preclude noninjecting drug users from participation; 
 
establish procedures for identifying program participants that are consistent with 
confidentiality provisions; and 
 
establish a method of identification and authorization for program staff members 
who have access to hypodermic needles, syringes, or program records.

(5) the number of participants entering drug counseling and treatment; and (6) the number 
of referrals made by the program for drug counseling and treatment. 
 
With the advice and approval of the oversight committee, BCHD must develop and

HIV among program participants; (2) changes in the level of drug use, needle-sharing, and 
condoms among program participants; (3) the status of treatment and recovery for program

participants who entered drug treatment programs; (4) the impact of the program on risk 
behaviors for the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and other life-threatening bloodborne 
diseases among injecting drug users; (5) the cost-effectiveness of the program versus the

member or participant is not immune from criminal prosecution for (1) the redistribution 
of hypodermic needles or syringes in any form; (2) any activities not authorized or 
approved by the program; or (3) the possession or distribution of controlled paraphernalia 
or any other unlawful activity outside of the Baltimore City limits. 
 
Except for violations of any laws that could arise from, reside, attached to, or contained

participants do not have immunity from criminal prosecution for a violation of any law 
prohibiting or regulating the use, possession, dispensing, distribution, or promotion of
