FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Third Reader - Revised 
House Bill 895 
(Delegate Rogers) 
Economic Matters 
Finance and Education, Energy, and the 
Environment 
 
Employment and Insurance Equality for Service Members Act 
 
 
This bill generally establishes uniform definitions related to the military in the Business 
Occupations and Professions, Business Regulation, Commercial Law, Economic 
Development, Financial Institutions, General Provisions, Insurance, Labor and 
Employment, State Finance and Procurement, and State Government Articles of the 
Maryland Code – primarily by reference to definitions in the U.S. Code. While numerous 
alterations within the bill represent only stylistic or technical changes, there are substantive 
changes. These changes generally make some provisions more broadly applicable to 
additional service members, including those related to eligibility for certain benefits 
(e.g., exemption from license renewal fees, eligibility under specified loan programs, etc.). 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Special fund revenues increase minimally in FY 2026 only due to form 
filings with the Maryland Insurance Administration; otherwise, State finances are not 
anticipated to be materially affected as the bill applies in a limited number of cases. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect local government finances or 
operations. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  The bill adds the definition of several military terms to the 
State Government Article (§ 9-901). This includes the definition of “military family” as 
well as all terms found in Exhibit 1 below. “Military family” includes the spouse and 
dependent children of a service member or veteran related by blood, marriage, or adoption.

HB 895/ Page 3 
The bill alters numerous provisions of State law that extend applicability to individuals, 
groups, or programs meeting certain requirements, generally related to military service. In 
certain instances, the bill expands the provisions to apply more broadly. For example, the 
bill repeals numerous references to the armed forces and replaces them with 
uniformed services, thereby extending applicability to members of the Public Health 
Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These substitutions – 
as well as other changes that are clarifying or technical in nature (and do not otherwise 
expand applicability) – are among those made within various sections of statute, including 
provisions related to: 
 
 
business licensing (including license renewals, educational requirements, expedited 
licenses, temporary licenses, etc.); 
 
false impersonation of an officer or member of the military, including the wearing 
of specified insignia; 
 
use of a deceased soldier’s identity; 
 
the Military Personnel and Veteran‐Owned Small Business No‐Interest Loan Fund;  
 
expedited licensing for mortgage loan originators; 
 
waiver of customer liability for certain public utility payments in the event of 
qualified events (e.g., call to active service); 
 
fraternal benefit societies organized to provide insurance and other benefits to their 
members and the dependents/beneficiaries of their members; 
 
applications for a license as a resident insurance producer, including reinstatements; 
 
license reinstatement fees for public adjusters who are affected by certain 
circumstances (e.g., military service); 
 
policy limitations for long-term care insurance; 
 
eligibility requirements for automobile insurance; 
 
discrimination in underwriting for military personnel returning from active duty 
overseas; 
 
apprenticeship credit for active military service; 
 
leave from work due to deployment of an immediate family member; 
 
unemployment insurance eligibility; 
 
unemployment insurance benefits after voluntarily leaving a place of employment; 
 
benefits and claims under the Maryland Family and Medical Leave Insurance 
Program; 
 
eligibility under the Maryland Workforce Development Act; and 
 
veteran-owned small business enterprise participation.
