Stockholder Approval Not Required – Transfer of Assets 
 
Under current law (§ 3‐104 of the Corporations and Associations Article), unless the 
charter or bylaws of a corporation provide otherwise by reference to § 3‐104 or its subject 
matter, the approval of the stockholders is not required for any: 
 
 
transfer of assets by a corporation in the ordinary course of business actually 
conducted by it or as a distribution, as specified;

HB 1171/ Page 2 
 
mortgage, pledge, or creation of any other security interest in any or all of the assets 
of a corporation, whether or not in the ordinary course of its business; 
 
transfer of assets by a corporation to one or more persons if all of the equity interests 
of the person or persons are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation; 
 
transfer of assets by a corporation registered as an open‐end investment company 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, including a transfer between or among 
classes or series of stock of a corporation; or 
 
transfers of assets by a corporation that is dissolved. 
 
Further, unless the charter or bylaws of a corporation provide otherwise by reference to 
§ 3‐104 or its subject matter, the approval of the stockholders and articles of share 
exchange are not required for an exchange of shares of stock through voluntary action or 
under an agreement with the stockholders participating in the exchange. 
 
The bill adds provisions to those specified above related to a transfer of assets. Specifically, 
unless the charter or bylaws of a corporation provide otherwise, as specified, stockholder 
approval is not required for a transfer of assets that is collateral for securing a mortgage, 
pledge, or security interest if: 
 
 
the mortgagee, pledgee, or secured party exercises its rights under Title 9 of the 
Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, the Real Property Article, or other 
applicable law to affect the transfer or assets without the consent of the corporation; 
or 
 
the board of directors of the corporation authorizes an alternative sale of assets with 
the mortgagee, the pledgee, a secured party, or another person (1) that results in the 
reduction or elimination of the liabilities or obligations secured by the assets and 
(2) for which the value of the assets is less than or equal to the amount of the 
liabilities or obligations being reduced or eliminated. 
 
The receipt of consideration by the corporation or its stockholders in an alternative sale of 
assets, as specified above, may not create a presumption that the value of the assets is 
greater than the amount of liabilities or obligations being eliminated or reduced, as 
specified. 
 
Except for any proceeding against a corporation and another necessary party to enjoin a 
sale before the sale is completed, failure to satisfy the bill’s condition that the value of 
assets be less than or equal to the amount of the liabilities or obligations being reduced or 
eliminated in an alternative sale of assets authorized, as specified, may not invalidate a sale 
if the transferee of the assets (1) provided value for the assets, including the reduction or 
elimination of the liabilities or obligations secured by the assets and (2) acted in good faith. 
However, the aforementioned provisions may not be interpreted to eliminate any claim,

including (1) a claim for monetary damages arising from the director failing to satisfy the 
standard of conduct for directors, as specified, including a claim by or in the right of the 
corporation or (2) a claim for equitable relief. 
 
Articles of Merger – Content 
 
Under current law, in addition to the statutory provisions specifying the required content 
of articles of consolidation, merger, or share exchange, the articles of merger for a limited 
partnership, limited liability company, or partnership must include (1) the percentages of 
partnership (or membership) interest of each class or series of partnership or membership 
interest and (2) the class of partners or members and the respective percentage of 
partnership or membership interests in each class or series of partnership or membership 
interest. The bill repeals these requirements for a limited partnership, limited liability 
company, and partnership and makes conforming changes. 
 
Small Business Effect:  By authorizing the transfer of assets that are collateral for securing 
specified interests without the approval of stockholders, the bill may benefit the finances 
and operation of a corporation. 
 
Additional Comments:  The bill implements recommendations of the Maryland State Bar 
Association, whose Committee on Corporation Law regularly reviews the Corporations 
and Associations Article in an attempt to clarify unclear provisions and eliminate outdated 
language.
