Bill Summary: 
 
Language Assistance Program, In General 
 
The bill establishes a Language Assistance Program and requires a local board of elections 
to participate in the program if SBE determines there is a significant need for language 
assistance to voters in the county in a language other than English. 
 
Each local board that is required to participate in the program must, with oversight from 
SBE, provide to voters the language assistance services required by the bill. 
 
SBE must provide to the local boards licensed translation software services to implement 
the program, and the county must pay for all other expenses associated with the program, 
including necessary hardware and each use of the translation software services. 
 
SBE must adopt regulations to carry out the bill. 
 
Determination of Need for Language Assistance and Designated Languages 
 
SBE must determine by February 1 of the year of an election that a significant need for 
language assistance to voters exists in a county if, based on the best available data, 
including information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey or 
data of comparable quality collected by a public office: 
 
 
more than 2% of the citizen voting age population of the county use a single shared 
language other than English and have limited English proficiency; or 
 
more than 4,000 individuals of the citizen voting age population of the county use a 
single shared language other than English and have limited English proficiency. 
 
“Limited English proficiency” means that an individual (1) speaks a particular language 
other than English; (2) does not speak English as a primary language; and (3) speaks, reads, 
or understands the English language less than “very well,” as reported in available 
U.S. Census Bureau data or data of comparable quality collected by a public office. 
 
SBE must determine that each language other than English that is used by individuals that 
make up more than 2%, or number more than 4,000, of the citizen voting age population 
of the county, and have limited English proficiency, is a designated language. 
 
By January 1, 2026, SBE must (1) publish and maintain on its website a list of each local 
board that is required to provide language assistance in a language other than English and

HB 983/ Page 3 
each designated language in which the language assistance is required to be provided by 
the local board and (2) update the information published and maintained at least every 
two years. 
 
The State Administrator of Elections must promptly notify each local board (and the chief 
financial officer of the county) included on the list of the bill’s language assistance 
requirements. 
 
Language Assistance Services 
 
Each local board that is required to participate in the program must, with oversight from 
SBE, provide to voters the following services: 
 
 
at each early voting center and Election Day polling place, the option for a voter 
who has a need for language assistance in a designated language to communicate 
with the election judges through a translator; 
 
SBE-approved signage in each early voting center and Election Day polling place 
in each designated language notifying voters that language assistance and 
interpretation services are available; and 
 
online voting materials (statewide voter registration applications, SBE-approved 
absentee ballot applications, specimen ballots, and forms and instructions SBE 
determines necessary to voting) in each designated language. 
 
A local board may provide solely oral instructions or other assistance if the language does 
not have a written form, such as American Sign Language. 
 
The local board must make reasonable efforts to recruit bilingual election judges to provide 
assistance to voters in designated languages and, with SBE approval, may provide 
additional language assistance services not required by the bill. 
 
Current Law:  Under Section 203 of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, states and 
political subdivisions that meet specified thresholds of numbers of citizens of voting age 
who are members of a specified single language minority and are limited-English proficient 
must provide any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other 
materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, in the language 
of the applicable minority group as well as in the English language. If the language of the 
applicable minority group is oral or unwritten, or in the case of Alaskan natives and 
American Indians, if the predominant language is historically unwritten, the State or 
political subdivision is only required to furnish oral instructions, assistance, or other 
information relating to registration and voting.

HB 983/ Page 4 
In general, a state or political subdivision is subject to Section 203 if the Director of the 
Census determines, based on specified data, that: 
 
 
(1) more than 5% of the citizens of voting age of such state or political subdivision 
are members of a single language minority and are limited-English proficient; 
(2) more than 10,000 of the citizens of voting age of such political subdivision are 
members of a single language minority and are limited-English proficient; or (3) in 
the case of a political subdivision that contains all or any part of an 
Indian reservation, more than 5% of the American Indian or Alaska Native citizens 
of voting age within the Indian reservation are members of a single language 
minority and are limited-English proficient; and 
 
the illiteracy rate of the citizens in the language minority group is higher than the 
national illiteracy rate. 
 
State Expenditures:  General fund expenditures increase by $122,000 in fiscal 2026, 
reflecting costs for SBE to (1) hire a demographics consultant to assist SBE in determining, 
every two years, which local boards must provide language assistance under the program, 
and in which designated languages, based on the best available data ($50,000) and  
(2) procure translation software services licenses to be made available to the local boards 
($72,000). 
 
This estimate assumes that the licensed translation software services are procured for local 
boards that collectively manage approximately 50% of early voting centers and Election 
Day polling places in the State, assuming that while only a relatively small number of 
counties may be required to participate in the program, those counties likely are larger 
counties that contain a significant portion of overall early voting centers and Election Day 
polling places in the State. The estimate of the cost of translation software services licenses 
is based on costs incurred by the Prince George’s County board of elections for similar 
services during the 2024 presidential election cycle. The estimate assumes that similar to 
the Prince George’s County board of elections, SBE incurs a one-time cost ($99) per 
license for each device (phone or tablet) on which the services are used (approximately 
one license per Election Day polling place, assuming one device is used in each Election 
Day polling place and devices used at early voting centers are reused at Election Day 
polling places). 
 
General fund expenditures increase by at least $50,000 in fiscal 2028 and 2030, consisting 
of (1) ongoing consultant costs to assist SBE in determining, at least every two years, the 
local boards required to participate in the program ($50,000) and (2) costs to purchase any 
additional translation software services licenses to the extent additional local boards are 
required to participate in the program in the 2028 and 2030 elections.

HB 983/ Page 5 
The estimate assumes that the bill’s requirement that local boards participating in the 
program provide online voting materials (including statewide voter registration 
applications and SBE-approved absentee ballot applications) in each designated language 
is not interpreted to require that SBE’s online voter registration and mail-in ballot request 
system incorporate designated languages. 
 
Local Expenditures:  Local government expenditures are expected to increase, beginning 
in fiscal 2026, for counties that must participate in the program to cover (1) costs incurred 
by local boards of elections to provide licensed translation software services, beyond the 
cost of the licenses, including costs of any necessary hardware (phones, tablets) the local 
board does not already possess and the cost for each use of the translation software services; 
(2) costs for signage at early voting centers and Election Day polling places indicating the 
availability of language assistance; and (3) costs of written translation services needed to 
provide online voting materials in each designated language. 
 
Overall local government costs to comply with the bill cannot be reliably estimated at this 
time; however, for context: 
 
 
the Prince George’s County board of elections incurred costs of approximately 
$13,000 that were in addition to the cost of the translation software services 
licenses, which included costs for tablet kiosks used at the board’s headquarters and 
early voting centers (the board’s total costs were $37,000, $23,900 of which was 
the cost of the licenses); 
 
the overall cost for each use of the licensed translation software services is expected 
to be minimal;  
 
one-time signage costs, based on local board estimates for voting location signage, 
are likely not more than $5,000 and may be less, potentially in the range of $3,000; 
 
costs of written translation services are expected to be relatively minimal based on 
(1) costs provided by SBE for written translation services under a State master 
contract; (2) the fact that there is a certain amount of existing translation of 
statewide voting materials; and (3) the potential for translation of additional 
statewide voting materials to be coordinated among counties that must provide 
language assistance services under the program in the same designated language(s), 
reducing costs; and 
 
future year costs may be relatively minimal and include (1) costs for wireless data 
plans for any devices purchased to implement the bill; (2) cost for each use of the 
licensed translation software services; (3) costs of written translation services; and 
(4) costs of any additional/replacement devices or signage.
