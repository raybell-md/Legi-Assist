Criminal Procedure - Victims and Witnesses - Out of Court Statement of Child 
to Forensic Interviewer 
 
 
This bill generally expands statutory evidentiary provisions that authorize the admission of 
an out of court statement in a juvenile court or criminal proceeding made by a child victim 
or witness to certain professionals under specified circumstances to also be applicable to 
statements made to a forensic interviewer. The bill defines “forensic interviewer” as a 
professional who (1) is trained in child forensic interviewing protocols and techniques that 
allow for neutral, legally sound, nonleading, and developmentally appropriate interviews 
with children to gather information without influencing the information provided by the 
child; (2) is not a law enforcement officer; and (3) is employed by or works under contract 
with a child advocacy center or an entity in another jurisdiction that would qualify as a 
child advocacy center in the State.

rule, which generally prohibits the admission into evidence of an out of court statement 
offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. 
 
Admissibility of Out of Court Statements Made by Child Victims and Witnesses 
 
A court is authorized to admit into evidence in a juvenile court proceeding or in a criminal 
proceeding an out of court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the 
statement made by a child victim or witness who is younger than age 13 and (1) is an 
alleged victim or a witness in a case before the court concerning a crime of violence, as 
specified by the Criminal Law Article, or (2) is the alleged victim or the child alleged to 
need assistance in the case before the court concerning certain matters, as specified 
(e.g., child abuse, rape or sexual offense, neglect of a minor, etc.). 
 
“Statement” is defined as (1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct intended 
as an assertion, including sounds, gestures, demonstrations, drawings, and similar actions. 
The statutory provisions regarding these statements do not limit the admissibility of a 
statement under any other applicable hearsay exception or rule of evidence. 
 
An out of court statement made by a child victim or witness under these provisions may be 
admissible only if the statement was made to and is offered by specified individuals, 
including physicians, nurses, teachers, or social workers, while the individual was acting 
lawfully in the course of the person’s profession. 
 
An out of court statement by a child victim or witness may come into evidence in a criminal 
proceeding or in a juvenile court proceeding other than a child in need of assistance (CINA) 
proceeding to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement if the child victim or 
witness testifies and if the statement is not admissible under any other hearsay exception. 
An out of court statement by a child victim may come into evidence in a CINA proceeding 
to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement (1) regardless of whether the child 
victim testifies and (2) if the statement is not admissible under any other hearsay exception. 
 
If the child victim does not testify, the child victim’s out of court statement is admissible 
only if there is corroborative evidence that the alleged offender had the opportunity to 
commit the alleged abuse or neglect. 
 
The prosecuting attorney is required to serve on the defendant, child respondent, or alleged 
offender and the attorney for the defendant, child respondent, or alleged offender with 
notice of (1) the State’s intention to introduce the statement and the content of the 
statement; (2) any audio or visual recording of the statement; and (3) if an audio or visual 
recording of the statement is not available, the content of the statement. Statutory 
provisions specify additional requirements regarding notice and depositions.

HB 442/ Page 3 
The out of court statement of a child victim or witness is only admissible if it has 
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. To determine the trustworthiness of the 
statement, the court must consider multiple factors, as specified in statute, including (1) the 
child victim or witness’s personal knowledge of the event; (2) the certainty that the 
statement was made; (3) any apparent motive to fabricate or exhibit partiality by the child 
victim or witness, including interest, bias, corruption, or coercion; and (4) whether the 
statement was spontaneous or directly responsive to questions. 
 
The court is required to make a finding on the record regarding the trustworthiness of the 
statement and determine the admissibility of the statement in a hearing outside of the 
presence of the jury or before the juvenile court proceeding. Statute includes additional 
requirements regarding the court’s examination of a child victim or witness. 
 
Child Advocacy Center 
 
Title 13 of the Health General Article defines a “child advocacy center” as a child-focused 
entity within or outside a health care facility that investigates, diagnoses, and treats children 
who may have been abused or neglected that (1) includes local law enforcement officers, 
local criminal prosecutors, and the local department of social services and (2) may include 
child mental health service providers and other children and family service providers.
