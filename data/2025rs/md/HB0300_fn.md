FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 300 
(Delegate Kerr, et al.) 
Health and Government Operations 
Budget and Taxation 
 
State Government - Grants and Contracts - Reimbursement of Indirect Costs 
 
 
This emergency bill repeals a requirement that a State grant or contract – funded wholly 
by State funds, or with a combination of State and other nonfederal funds, and awarded to 
a nonprofit organization that has not negotiated and received a specified indirect cost rate 
– allow the nonprofit organization to reimburse indirect costs at a rate equal to at least 10%. 
Instead, a nonprofit organization may reimburse indirect costs at the greater of the 
de minimis rate established in specified federal regulations (currently 15%) or 15%.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  No effect on the total value of State contracts and grants to nonprofit 
organizations. However, to the extent that nonprofit organizations currently reimburse 
indirect costs at 10%, they may allocate at least 5% more to indirect costs, likely with no 
material diminution in services. No effect on revenues. 
  
Local Effect:  Local governments that serve as pass-through entities for State grants must 
incorporate the higher reimbursement rate for indirect costs into their grants and contracts 
with nonprofit organizations, which they can do with existing resources. To the extent that 
local funds are commingled with State funds on some grants and contracts, nonprofit 
organizations can allocate at least 5% more to indirect costs, likely with no material 
diminution in services. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The de minimis rate referenced in the bill is established by Subpart E of 
the federal Office of Management and Budget’s Uniform Administrative Requirements,

Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (referred to as the “OMB 
Uniform Guidance” in State law). It is found in 2 CFR 200.414 and is currently set at 15%. 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 734 of 2018 required that the terms of a grant or contract for the 
provision of services by a nonprofit organization that is funded either wholly with State 
funds or with a combination of State and other nonfederal funds allow for reimbursement 
of indirect costs. Under Chapter 734, indirect costs must be reimbursed at the rate that the 
nonprofit organization has negotiated and received either (1) under a direct federal award 
or (2) from a nonfederal entity based on specified federal cost principles. If the nonprofit 
organization has not negotiated and received an indirect cost rate under a direct federal 
award, it must be reimbursed at a rate of at least 10% of specified costs. The requirements 
of Chapter 734 apply if State funds are transferred to the nonprofit organization either 
directly by the State or through a third party. 
 
Chapters 640 and 641 of 2019 clarified that Chapter 734 applies only to:   
 
 
a grant or contract awarded on or after October 1, 2018; 
 
a multi-year grant or contract awarded before October 1, 2018, if the grant or 
contract remains in effect after that date and funding for the grant or contract is 
required to be authorized separately for each fiscal year; and 
 
an extension or a renewal of a grant or contract if the extension or renewal was 
awarded on or after July 1, 2019. 
 
They further clarified that reimbursement is not required for indirect costs incurred under 
a multi-year grant or contract during any fiscal year that begins before July 1, 2019. 
 
Additional Comments:  Some State agencies advise that they already incorporate the 
OMB Uniform Guidance into their grant agreements, so some nonprofit organizations will 
experience no effect.
