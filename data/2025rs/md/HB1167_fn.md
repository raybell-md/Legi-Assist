Montgomery County - Municipal Authority to Regulate Structures - Alterations

This bill modifies provisions that authorize a municipality or governed special taxing 
district within the portion of the Maryland-Washington Regional District in 
Montgomery County to impose specified additional or stricter building requirements (than 
State, regional, or county requirements), as described below under Current Law, on 
single-family residential houses, buildings, or other structures on land zoned for 
single-family residential use. The bill modifies the provisions so that an additional or 
stricter requirement (1) applies to residential buildings with four or fewer dwelling units, 
including single-unit houses, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, cottage clusters, townhouses, 
and similar buildings, and their accessory structures, without regard to the zoning for the 
land, and (2) otherwise applies without regard to housing type, subject to a provision that 
establishes that an additional or stricter requirement may not be more restrictive for 
residential buildings with two to four dwelling units than for a single-unit house but may 
be less restrictive. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill does not directly affect State finances. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not expected to directly affect local government finances. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Potential meaningful.

Analysis 
 
Current Law: 
 
Additional or Stricter Requirements for Single-family Residential Houses 
 
By local law, the legislative body of a municipality or governed special taxing district 
within the portion of the regional district in Montgomery County may impose an additional 
or stricter building requirement than is required by a State, regional, or county unit that 
exercises zoning or planning authority over the municipality or governed district if the 
authority is exercised in addition to the State, regional, or county zoning or planning 
authority. 
 
An additional or stricter building requirement: 
 
 
must be imposed for (1) the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare or 
(2) the preservation, improvement, or protection of lands, water, and improvements 
in the municipality or governed district; and 
 
may regulate only the construction, repair, or remodeling of single-family 
residential houses, buildings, or other structures on land zoned for single-family 
residential use, relating to (1) fences, walls, hedges, and similar barriers; (2) signs;  
(3) residential parking; (4) residential storage; (5) the location of structures, 
including setback requirements; (6) the dimensions of structures, including height, 
bulk, massing, and design; and (7) lot coverage, including impervious surfaces. 
 
Before a local law is adopted, a copy must be transmitted to the county council and a public 
hearing must be held. A local law also must provide a procedure for a waiver from the strict 
application of the building requirements. 
 
“Governed special taxing district” means a special taxing district that (1) has an elected 
local governing body and (2) performs general municipal functions. 
 
Maryland-Washington Regional District 
 
Division II of the Land Use Article (within which the bill’s changes are made) establishes 
the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) (made up of 
the Montgomery and Prince George’s County planning boards) and governs planning and 
zoning within the Maryland-Washington Regional District (§ 20-101 of the Land Use 
Article), which consists of (1) the entire area of Montgomery County, subject to certain 
limitations (relating to certain municipalities not subject to the planning and zoning 
authority of the county, unless by agreement, and other municipalities that have certain, 
limited planning and zoning authority) and (2) the entire area of Prince George’s County, 
except for the City of Laurel as it existed on July 1, 2013.

District Councils 
 
The county councils of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties are the district councils 
for that portion of the regional district located within the respective counties. The 
district councils have the authority to adopt and amend the zoning law and any map for the 
portion of the regional district within the counties. 
 
Municipalities in the Regional District in Montgomery County 
 
Within the portion of the regional district in Montgomery County, the zoning powers 
vested by Division I of the Land Use Article in a municipality or the council of a 
municipality are construed to be vested in the district council of the county with the 
exception of certain municipalities within which M-NCPPC, the county planning board, 
and the district council may not exercise planning or zoning power except by specified 
agreement and with the exception of certain, limited authority of the City of Takoma Park 
and the Town of Kensington. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Small businesses involved in construction, repair, or remodeling 
of residential buildings with two to four dwelling units within affected municipalities in 
the regional district in Montgomery County may be meaningfully affected by additional or 
stricter building requirements imposed on such construction, repair, or remodeling 
pursuant to the bill.
