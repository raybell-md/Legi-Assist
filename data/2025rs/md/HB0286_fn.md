2025 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Third Reader - Revised 
House Bill 286 
(Chair, Environment and Transportation Committee)(By 
Request - Departmental - Planning) 
Environment and Transportation 
Education, Energy, and the Environment 
 
Local Comprehensive Planning and State Economic Growth, Resource 
Protection, and Planning Policy - Planning Principles 
 
 
This departmental bill replaces the 12 “visions” – that a local planning commission must 
implement through a local jurisdiction’s comprehensive plan – with 8 “planning 
principles.” The bill establishes (1) the goals of the planning principles and (2) that the 
goals should be accomplished through public participation and stewardship. 
Correspondingly, the bill (1) alters identical text – that makes up the State Economic 
Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Policy – in the same manner, so that the policy 
consists of the 8 “planning principles,” and (2) references the new policy under specified 
criteria for State funding of growth-related transportation projects that are not in a priority 
funding area, as described below. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill does not directly affect State finances. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not expected to have a direct, material impact on local 
government finances. 
 
Small Business Effect:  The Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) has determined 
that this bill has a meaningful impact on small business (attached). The Department of 
Legislative Services (DLS) generally concurs with this assessment, noting that the 
meaningful impact of the bill on small business occurs indirectly. (The attached assessment 
does not reflect amendments to the bill.)

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law: 
 
Local Comprehensive Plans and the State Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and 
Planning Policy – Planning Principles 
 
The bill replaces the 12 “visions” – that a local planning commission must implement 
through a comprehensive plan, and that make up the State Economic Growth, Resource 
Protection, and Planning Policy – with 8 “planning principles,” as shown in Exhibit 1. 
 
The bill establishes – with respect to implementation of the planning principles through a 
comprehensive plan – that the collective intent of the planning principles is to create 
sustainable communities and to protect the environment in order to foster a high quality of 
life for all residents of the State. To accomplish these goals, residents should be active 
partners in the planning and implementation of community initiatives and sensitive to their 
responsibilities as stewards in balancing and achieving community goals. 
 
Under current law (and under the bill), counties and municipalities must review and update 
their comprehensive plan at least once every 10 years. 
 
Transportation Projects Outside of Priority Funding Areas 
 
Under current law (and under the bill), the State may not provide funding for a 
growth-related project (defined in § 5-7B-01 of the State Finance and Procurement Article) 
if the project is not located within a priority funding area (defined in § 5-7B-02 of the State 
Finance and Procurement Article), subject to exceptions if specified criteria are met. 
Among various criteria under current law for the State to provide funding for a 
growth-related transportation project that is not in a priority funding area, is a criterion that 
adequate access control or other measures are in place to prevent development that is 
inconsistent with specified elements of the current State Economic Growth, Resource 
Protection, and Planning Policy. The bill instead requires, under that criterion, that 
adequate access control or other measures are in place to prevent development that is 
inconsistent with the full, new State Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning 
Policy established by the bill (the 8 new planning principles, shown in Exhibit 1). 
 
Cross-references 
 
The bill requires the publisher of the Annotated Code of Maryland, in consultation with 
and subject to the approval of DLS, to (1) correct cross-references and terminology 
rendered incorrect by the bill and (2) describe any correction made in an editor’s note 
following the section affected.

Protection, and Planning Policy 
 
“Visions” (Under Current Law) Are Replaced by “Planning Principles” (Under the Bill) 
 
Current Law – Visions 
Under the Bill – Planning Principles 
(1) quality of life and sustainability – a 
high quality of life is achieved through 
universal stewardship of the land, water, 
and 
air 
resulting 
in 
sustainable 
communities and protection of the 
environment; 
(2) public participation – citizens are active 
partners 
in 
the 
planning 
and 
implementation of community initiatives 
and are sensitive to their responsibilities 
in achieving community goals; 
(3) growth areas – growth is concentrated in 
existing population and business centers, 
growth areas adjacent to these centers, or 
strategically selected new centers; 
(4) community 
design 
– 
compact, 
mixed-use, walkable design consistent 
with existing community character and 
located near available or planned transit 
options is encouraged to ensure efficient 
use of land and transportation resources 
and preservation and enhancement of 
natural 
systems, 
open 
spaces, 
recreational 
areas, 
and 
historical, 
cultural, and archaeological resources; 
(5) infrastructure – growth areas have the 
water resources and infrastructure to 
accommodate population and business 
expansion in an orderly, efficient, and 
environmentally sustainable manner; 
(6) transportation – a well-maintained, 
multimodal 
transportation 
system 
facilitates 
the 
safe, 
convenient, 
affordable, and efficient movement of 
people, goods, and services within and 
between population and business centers; 
(1) 
land – optimize productivity of 
working landscapes, including farms 
and forests, and fisheries, and prioritize 
development within population centers 
that are in proximity to existing 
infrastructure and facilities;  
(2) 
transportation 
– 
prioritize 
transportation networks that create 
energy 
efficient, 
affordable, 
and 
reliable access to jobs, housing, and 
services;  
(3) 
housing – enable a mix of quality 
housing types and affordability options 
to accommodate all who want to live in 
the State;  
(4) 
economy – allow for adaptive reuse, 
mixed-use, and context appropriate 
new development that responds to 
changing markets and innovations;  
(5) 
equity – engage all sectors of the 
community in plan development to 
ensure diverse voices are heard and the 
needs of underserved populations are 
prioritized; 
(6) 
resilience 
– 
integrate 
resiliency 
measures that will minimize the 
impacts of rapid and unexpected 
natural- and human-caused threats on 
communities; 
(7) 
place – provide for public spaces that 
encourage social interaction and value 
cultural, 
historical, 
and 
natural 
resources; and  
(8) 
ecology – protect and restore sensitive 
ecological 
systems 
and 
conserve

Background:  MDP indicates that replacing the 12 “visions” with 8 “planning principles” 
(1) clarifies and simplifies the State’s growth/planning policy; (2) expands the policy’s 
focus to sustainable growth through the inclusion of principles on resilience and equity; 
and (3) addresses practical difficulty experienced by local planning officials and their staff 
in implementing the 12 visions alongside other comprehensive plan requirements. 
 
 
(7) housing – a range of housing densities, 
types, and sizes provides residential 
options for citizens of all ages and 
incomes; 
(8) economic development – economic 
development and natural resource-based 
businesses that promote employment 
opportunities for all income levels within 
the capacity of the State’s natural 
resources, public services, and public 
facilities are encouraged; 
(9) environmental protection – land and 
water 
resources, 
including 
the 
Chesapeake and coastal bays, are 
carefully 
managed 
to 
restore 
and 
maintain healthy air and water, natural 
systems, and living resources; 
(10) resource conservation – waterways, 
forests, agricultural areas, open space, 
natural systems, and scenic areas are 
conserved; 
(11) stewardship – government, business 
entities, and residents are responsible for 
the creation of sustainable communities 
by collaborating to balance efficient 
growth with resource protection; and 
(12) implementation – strategies, policies, 
programs, and funding for growth and 
development, 
resource 
conservation, 
infrastructure, and transportation are 
integrated across the local, regional, 
State, and interstate levels to achieve 
these visions.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL: 
Local Comprehensive Planning and State Economic Growth, 
Resource Protection, and Planning Policy - Planning Principles 
 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB 286 
 
PREPARED BY: 
Andrew Wilson, Department of Planning Government Affairs 
Specialist 
 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
          WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
 
   X    WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
 
 
 
PART B.  ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
This proposal aims to rebuild the State’s Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and 
Planning Policy (Policy) by consolidating the Policy’s “visions” into eight planning 
principles that will guide and inform State and local planning practices. Given that this 
rebuilding focuses on aspects that touch substantial pillars of small business operations, 
from land use and transportation to economy, equity, and housing, this proposal will have 
a meaningful, positive impact on Maryland small businesses. This positive impact will be 
realized due to increased attention, understanding, and usage of the Policy by planners and 
throughout planning practices in the State.
