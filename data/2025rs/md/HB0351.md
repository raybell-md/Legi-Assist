to present evidence satisfactory to the Board of Public Works that the matching fund will
be provided. If satisfactory evidence is presented, the Board shall certify this fact to the
State Treasurer and the proceeds of the loan shall be expended for the purposes provided in

applied to the purposes authorized in § 8–129 of the State Finance and Procurement Article.

Properties, unless the Director of the Trust also determines that the real property:

(i) Is a type that is already adequately represented among the
Trust’s existing easement properties;

(ii) Is already subject to adequate protections of historic preservation
law or instrument; or

(iii) Has conditions peculiar to it that make requiring an easement

force and effect. If bonds have been issued for the loan, the amount of unexpended or
unencumbered bond proceeds shall be disposed of as provided in § 8–129 of the State
Finance and Procurement Article.

(8) Multiple grants provided to the same organization in this Section are in

that the proposed use of funds is consistent with the public purpose of the original
appropriation; or

(ii) The location of the project.

(b) When the difference in the name of the grantee is nonsubstantive and
the identity of the grantee can be determined, and when the difference in the description of
the project is nonsubstantive and is consistent with the public purpose of the original
appropriation, the Department of General Services shall record the correct grantee
identification and project description in the grant agreement entered into by the grantee
with the State of Maryland and recorded with the Board of Public Works. In all other
instances of differences provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the Department of
Budget and Management shall notify the Office of Policy Analysis within the Department

with the public purpose of the appropriation.

(c) (i) The Office of Policy Analysis shall have 45 days to review and
comment on the proposed use of the funds.

(ii) If the Office of Policy Analysis does not submit written objections
within 45 days, the Department of Budget and Management shall provide certification in
writing to the Board of Public Works that the proposed use of funds may be approved
notwithstanding differences in the appropriation in Section 1(3) Items ZA00 through ZB02
of this Act.

(d) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of this
paragraph:

(i) Provide an administrative process authorizing the approval of
grants by the Board of Public Works, provided that the proposed use of funds is consistent
with the public purpose of the original appropriation; and

(ii) Be applicable to this Act and all prior Maryland Consolidated
Capital Bond Loans.

(10) Notwithstanding § 8–122.1 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, the
principal amount of any loan authorized under this Act shall be reduced by the cash
proceeds, excluding any accrued interest, received for the State bonds and allocated by the
Comptroller to the loan.

(11) Notwithstanding §§ 8–125(e) and 8–132 of the State Finance and Procurement
Article, the State Treasurer shall determine the amount of premium from the sale of bonds
in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 to be transferred to the Annuity Bond Fund. Upon each
issuance of State bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the Treasurer shall notify the
Comptroller of the Treasurer’s determination and the Comptroller shall credit the premium
accordingly. Premium from the sale of bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 that is not
transferred to the Annuity Bond Fund may, upon approval of the Board of Public Works, be
expended by the Comptroller for any of the public purposes set forth in Section 1(3) of this
Act, including any applicable architects’ and engineers’ fees.
