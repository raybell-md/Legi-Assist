Criminal Law - Controlled Dangerous Substances and Firearms 
 
 
This bill (1) establishes reduced penalties for cannabis-related violations of the prohibitions 
on being a volume dealer under § 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article and a drug kingpin 
under § 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article; (2) authorizes specified individuals 
incarcerated for violations of §§ 5-612 and 5-613 to file an application for a modification 
or reduction of a mandatory minimum sentence; (3) modifies penalties and crime 
classifications for specified firearms offenses; and (4) authorizes a person at least age 21 to

cannabis, a violation of the volume dealer statute is a felony.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General fund expenditures for the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) 
increase by as much as $95,700 in FY 2026; future years reflect annualization, inflation, 
and elimination of one-time costs. State finances are otherwise not materially affected.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary: 
 
Manufacturing Cannabis Products and Concentrated Cannabis 
 
The bill authorizes a person who is at least age 21 to manufacture a personal use amount 
of cannabis products or concentrated cannabis for personal use or adult sharing at a private 
residence if the manufacturing process does not involve the use of a “volatile solvent.” A 
“volatile solvent” is defined as a solvent that is or produces a flammable gas or vapor that, 
when present in the air in sufficient quantities, will create explosive or ignitable mixtures. 
 
Alteration of Classification and Penalties – Volume Dealer and Drug Kingpin Offenses 
 
Volume Dealer:  The bill establishes that a person who violates the volume dealer statute 
(§ 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article) by manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or 
possessing 50 pounds or more of cannabis (the quantity of cannabis specified under 
existing statute) is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a maximum 
sentence of 10 years imprisonment and/or a $50,000 fine. 
 
The remaining violations of the volume dealer statute, which apply to other types of 
controlled dangerous substances (CDS), are subject to the existing penalty of imprisonment 
for up to 20 years (with a mandatory minimum of sentence of 5 years) and a fine of up to 
$100,000. The bill also specifies in statute that a violation of the volume dealer statute for 
a substance other than cannabis is a felony. (While not specified in statute, the 
Maryland Sentencing Guidelines Offense Table currently specifies that any violation of 
§ 5-612 is a felony.) 
 
Drug Kingpin:  The bill establishes that a person who violates the drug kingpin statute 
(§ 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article) by conspiring to manufacture, distribute, dispense, 
transport, or bring into the State 50 pounds or more of cannabis (the quantity of cannabis 
specified under existing statute) is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to a 
maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and/or a $100,000 fine. The remaining 
violations of the drug kingpin statute, which apply to other types of CDS, are subject to the 
existing penalty (felony punishable by imprisonment for up to 40 years (with a mandatory 
minimum sentence of 20 years) and/or a fine of up to $1.0 million). 
 
Authorization to Request Sentence Modification or Reduction 
 
A person who is serving a term of confinement that includes a mandatory minimum 
sentence for a violation of § 5-612 (volume dealer statute) or § 5-613 (drug kingpin statute) 
of the Criminal Law Article may file an application with the court or sentence review panel 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 413/ Page 3 
by September 30, 2026, for a modification or reduction of the mandatory minimum 
sentence, as provided in Maryland Rule 4-345, regardless of whether the defendant filed a 
timely motion for reconsideration or such a motion was denied by the court if:  
 
 
the sentence was imposed on or before September 30, 2017, and involved less than 
448 grams of cocaine base (under this scenario, only one application may be filed); 
or  
 
the sentence was imposed on or before September 30, 2025, and involved cannabis 
(under this scenario, if the first motion is denied, a second application may be filed 
no earlier than three years after the denial). 
 
The court must notify the State’s Attorney and hold a hearing if such an application is filed. 
The court may modify the sentence and depart from the mandatory minimum sentence 
unless the State shows that, giving due regard to the nature of the crime, the history and 
character of the defendant, and the defendant’s chances of successful rehabilitation, 
retention of the mandatory minimum sentence would not result in substantial injustice to 
the defendant and the mandatory minimum sentence is necessary for the protection of the 
public. The court may consider an application filed after the September 30, 2026 deadline 
for good cause shown. 
 
Alterations of Classification and Penalties – Firearm Offenses 
 
The bill modifies the classifications and penalty provisions for various firearm offenses 
under the Public Safety Article. Exhibit 1 details the classifications and penalties under 
current law and under the bill.

Drug Kingpin (§ 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article) 
 
“Drug kingpin” means an organizer, supervisor, financier, or manager who acts as a 
coconspirator in a conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, dispense, transport in, or bring 
into the State a CDS. 
 
A drug kingpin who conspires to manufacture, distribute, dispense, transport in, or bring 
into the State a CDS in an amount specified under the volume dealer statute (see above) is 
guilty of a felony. A violator is subject to a nonsuspendable and nonparolable minimum 
sentence of imprisonment for 20 years, a maximum sentence of 40 years imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole, and/or a fine of up to $1 million. 
 
Cannabis Reform  
 
Chapters 254 and 255 of 2023 established the adult-use cannabis industry in the State 
following the enactment of Chapter 26 of 2022 and the passage of the associated 
constitutional amendment by (1) creating the Maryland Cannabis Administration (MCA) 
as an independent unit of State government that is responsible for the regulation of medical 
and adult-use cannabis; (2) attributing cannabis-related duties to the Alcohol and Tobacco 
Commission and renaming it the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Cannabis Commission; 
(3) developing a licensing framework for the regulated sale of cannabis; (4) requiring all 
existing medical cannabis licensees to convert to adult-use cannabis businesses; 
(5) establishing a 9% sales and use tax on the sale of adult-use cannabis; and (6) creating 
the Office of Social Equity (OSE) in MCA and the Social Equity Partnership Grant 
Program in OSE. The sale of adult-use cannabis began on July 1, 2023. 
 
Adult-use Cannabis:  Pursuant to Chapter 26 and the passage of the associated 
constitutional amendment, a person at least age 21 may use and possess the personal use 
amount of cannabis. Possession of the personal use amount of cannabis by a person 
younger than age 21 and possession of the civil use amount of cannabis by anyone are 
subject to civil penalties. Possession of more than the civil use amount of cannabis by 
anyone is subject to a criminal penalty. 
 
“Personal use amount” means (1) up to 1.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) up to 12 grams 
of concentrated cannabis; (3) cannabis products containing up to 750 milligrams of 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); or (4) up to two cannabis plants. “Civil use amount” 
means (1) more than 1.5 ounces but not more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) more 
than 12 grams but not more than 20 grams of concentrated cannabis; or (3) cannabis 
products containing more than 750 milligrams but not more than 1,250 milligrams of 
delta-9-THC.

HB 413/ Page 7 
Possession with the Intent to Distribute and Adult Sharing of Cannabis:  As of  
January 1, 2023, a person may not possess cannabis in sufficient quantity to reasonably 
indicate under all circumstances an intent to distribute or dispense cannabis. However, 
possession of the personal use amount of cannabis or the civil use amount of cannabis 
without other evidence of an intent to distribute or dispense does not constitute a violation 
of this prohibition. A police officer must charge a violation of this provision by citation, as 
specified. A person who violates this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to 
imprisonment for up to three years and/or a $5,000 maximum fine. 
 
As of July 1, 2023, the prohibition against distributing, dispensing, or possessing with the 
intent to distribute a CDS does not prohibit adult sharing of the personal use amount of 
cannabis. A civil or criminal penalty may not be imposed for “adult sharing” (generally 
defined as the transfer of cannabis between persons who are at least age 21 without 
remuneration) of the personal use amount of cannabis. “Adult sharing” does not include 
instances in which (1) cannabis is given away contemporaneously with another reciprocal 
transaction between the same parties; (2) a gift of cannabis is offered or advertised in 
conjunction with an offer for the sale of goods or services; or (3) a gift of cannabis is 
contingent on a separate reciprocal transaction for goods or services. 
 
Cultivating Cannabis:  As of July 1, 2023, a person at least age 21 may cultivate up to 
two cannabis plants. However, no more than two cannabis plants may be cultivated at a 
single residence where two or more people at least age 21 reside. A person who cultivates 
cannabis must (1) cultivate cannabis in a location outside of public view;  
(2) take reasonable precautions, as specified, to ensure the plants are secure from 
unauthorized access and access by an underage person; and (3) only cultivate cannabis on 
property the cultivator lawfully possesses or with the consent of the property’s lawful 
possessor. An underage person may not cultivate cannabis. A person who violates these 
provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to imprisonment for up to three years 
and/or a $5,000 maximum fine. 
 
Manufacturing Cannabis Products:  A person may not manufacture a cannabis product, or 
manufacture, distribute, or possess a machine, equipment, an instrument, an implement, a 
device, or a combination of them that is adapted to produce cannabis or a cannabis product 
under circumstances that reasonably indicate an intent to use it to produce, sell, or dispense 
cannabis or a cannabis product in violation of Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article. A 
police officer must charge a violation of this provision by citation. A person who violates 
this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a maximum imprisonment for up 
to three years and/or a $5,000 maximum fine. 
 
State Revenues:  While the bill is not expected to have a material effect on general fund 
revenues overall, (1) general fund revenues may increase minimally from fines imposed in 
cases that shift from the circuit court to the District Court because of the bill’s 

END OF PAGE 7

HB 413/ Page 8 
reclassification of a volume dealer offense involving cannabis as a misdemeanor and 
(2) general fund revenues may decrease minimally from fines imposed in cases that shift 
from the District Court to the circuit court because of the bill’s reclassification of specified 
firearm offenses as felonies. 
 
State Expenditures:  General fund expenditures increase by as much as $95,726 in 
fiscal 2026 for OPD to hire one additional attorney; future year expenditures are 
annualized, adjusted for inflation, and reflect ongoing costs. Overall, the bill is not 
anticipated to materially affect the expenditures of the Department of Public Safety and 
Correctional Services (DPSCS), as discussed below. 
 
Relevant Offense Data 
 
Exhibit 2 displays the number of violations and guilty dispositions for offenses that may 
be eligible to file for an application for a modification of sentence under the bill. Exhibit 2 
does not include violations and dispositions in Baltimore City for the cocaine base offenses 
that occurred during fiscal 2015 and 2016. 
 
Exhibit 3 displays the number of violations and guilty dispositions for the firearms 
offenses affected by the bill in fiscal 2023 and 2024. 
 
Office of the Public Defender 
 
All of the incarcerated individuals subject to the bill’s authorization for sentence 
modifications and reductions likely qualify for OPD’s services due to incarceration status. 
OPD advises that the bill’s authorization to file sentence modifications and the bill’s 
alteration of firearm-related penalty provisions results in an increased caseload equivalent 
to that of three attorneys and one secretary. The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) 
advises that OPD may require additional staff, but DLS disagrees with the level of staffing 
required. 
 
Based on the data in Exhibit 2, the number of individuals convicted of and potentially 
eligible for a modification of sentence under the bill is not significant in each fiscal year. 
However, aggregating the number of guilty dispositions across the years for individuals 
incarcerated under specified provisions of § 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article (mandatory 
minimum sentence of 5 years and maximum sentence of 20 years) and § 5-613 of the 
Criminal Law Article (mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and a maximum sentence 
of 40 years) may result in the need for additional staff, considering the level of effort 
involved with sentence modifications and reductions. Data is not readily available on the 
number of incarcerated individuals eligible for sentence modifications under the bill.

OPD further advises that the bill’s establishment of an incarceration penalty for firearms 
offenses also increases OPD workloads. OPD does not represent individuals facing 
fine-only penalties. The bill only establishes an incarceration penalty for violations of 
§ 5-406 of the Public Safety Article, which according to the data above, did not result in 
any charges during the past two fiscal years. Therefore, any changes to OPD caseloads 
from potential future charges for this offense, which may involve additional charges for 
offenses already eligible for OPD representation, can be addressed with existing resources. 
 
Thus, general fund expenditures increase by as much as $95,726 in fiscal 2026, which 
accounts for the bill’s effective date of October 1, 2025. This estimate reflects the cost of 
hiring one assistant public defender to provide representation for increased workloads that 
result from the bill. It includes a salary, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, and 
ongoing operating expenses.

General fund expenditures may decrease minimally due to the bill’s elimination of 
mandatory minimum sentences and reduction of the maximum incarceration penalties for 
cannabis-related volume dealer and drug kingpin violations. General fund expenditures 
may increase minimally due to the bill’s establishment of incarceration penalties (rather 
than fine only penalties) for specified firearms offenses. Overall, the bill is not expected to 
materially affect DPSCS expenditures. 
 
Changing crimes from misdemeanors to felonies means that (1) such cases are likely to be 
filed in the circuit courts rather than the District Court and (2) some persons may eventually 
serve longer incarcerations due to more stringent penalty provisions, applicable to some 
offenses for prior felony convictions. Accordingly, it is assumed that this bill shifts an 
unknown number of cases from the District Court to the circuit courts. It is not known 
whether such a prospective shift may spur more plea bargains and affect actual sentencing 
practices for this offense. 
 
Local Revenues:  Revenues may decrease minimally from fines imposed in cases that 
shift from the circuit court to the District Court because of the bill’s classification of a 
volume dealer offense involving cannabis as a misdemeanor. Revenues may increase 
minimally from fines imposed in cases that shift from the District Court to the circuit court 
because of the bill’s classification of specified firearm offenses as felonies. Overall, the 
bill is not expected to have a material effect on local revenues. 
 
Local Expenditures:  The bill’s authorization for incarcerated individuals serving a 
sentence that includes a mandatory minimum for specified cocaine base or cannabis 
offenses under the volume dealer statute (§ 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article) or drug 
kingpin statute (§ 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article) to seek a modification or reduction 
of their sentences likely impacts the workload of the circuit courts to process applications 
and hold the required hearings. However, any impact from these provisions is not expected 
to have a material effect on circuit court operations or finances. 
 
The Maryland State’s Attorneys’ Association did not respond to a request for information 
regarding the bill’s fiscal and operational impact on State’s Attorney’s offices. DLS advises 
that depending on caseloads and existing resources within each jurisdiction, the bill’s 
sentence modification and reduction provisions may have a fiscal and/or operational impact 
on State’s Attorneys’ offices. Baltimore County advises that its State’s Attorney’s office 
does not anticipate a fiscal impact from the bill. 
 
Additional Comments:  In Johnson v. State, 467 Md. 362 (2020), the Court of Appeals 
(now the Supreme Court of Maryland) held that § 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article, which 
prohibits the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, or possession of specified CDS in 

END OF PAGE 11

START OF PAGE 12
    
HB 413/ Page 12 
specified amounts, unambiguously provides for a minimum term of imprisonment of 
5 years. The court also determined that legislative history shows that the maximum term 
of imprisonment for a violation of § 5-612 is 20 years. 
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Recent Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has been introduced within the last 
three years. See HB 346 and SB 404 of 2024 and HB 135 and SB 946 of 2023.
