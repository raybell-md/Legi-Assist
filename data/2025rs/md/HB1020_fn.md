House Bill 1020 
(Delegate Palakovich Carr)

Consumer Protection - Credit Reporting - Medical Debt (Fair Medical Debt 
Reporting Act) 
 
 
This bill prohibits (1) a consumer reporting agency from including certain information 
related to medical debt in a consumer report and (2) a person from using medical debt 
information included in a consumer report to make a determination regarding 
creditworthiness. The bill also prohibits a person (or the person’s agent or assignee) whose 
primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices from disclosing any 
portion of a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency. Any such person must also 
include, in any contract entered into with a collection entity for the purchase or collection 
of medical debt, a provision prohibiting the disclosure of any portion of the medical debt 
to a consumer reporting agency. A contract entered into on or after the bill’s effective date 
that does not include such a provision is void and unenforceable. The bill also makes 
generally conforming changes to statutory provisions governing hospital debt collection 
policies and requires, by November 1, 2025, hospitals that had reported adverse credit 
information about a patient to a consumer reporting agency to instruct the agency to delete 
the adverse information about the patient.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  “Medical debt” means debt owed by a consumer to (1) a person whose 
primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices or (2) the person’s 
agent or assignee for the provision of medical services, products, or devices. “Medical 
debt” includes medical bills that (1) are not past due or (2) have already been paid. 
However, it does not include debt charged to a credit card – unless the credit card is issued 
under an open-end or a closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care 
services. 
 
Under the bill, a consumer reporting agency may not:   
 
 
make, create, or furnish any consumer report containing, incorporating, or reflecting  
(1) any adverse information that the consumer reporting agency knows (or should 
know) relates to medical debt incurred by the consumer or (2) any collection action 
against a consumer to collect medical debt; or 
 
maintain in a file on a consumer any information relating to (1) medical debt 
incurred by the consumer or (2) any collection action against the consumer to collect 
medical debt. 
 
The reporting prohibitions apply regardless of when medical debt was incurred by a 
consumer. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Consumer Reports and Consumer Reporting Agencies 
 
A “consumer report” is any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a 
consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer’s credit worthiness, credit standing, 
credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living, 
which is used or expected to be used or collected (in whole or in part) for the purpose of 
serving as a factor in establishing a consumer’s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be 
used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (2) employment purposes; or 
(3) other specified purposes, as authorized by State law. 
 
A “consumer reporting agency” is any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a 
cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages (in whole or in part) in the practice of 
assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers 
for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means 
or facility of commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing the reports.

Hospital Debt Collection 
 
Each hospital must annually submit to the Health Services Cost Review Commission 
(HSCRC) the hospital’s debt collection policy and a report including (1) the total number 
of patients by race or ethnicity, gender, and zip code against whom the hospital, or a debt 
collector used by the hospital, filed an action to collect a debt owed on a hospital bill; 
(2) the total number of patients by race or ethnicity, gender, and zip code with respect to 
whom the hospital has and has not reported or classified as bad debt; and (3) the total dollar 
amount of the charges for hospital services provided to patients but not collected by the 
hospital for patients covered by insurance, including the out-of-pocket costs for patients 
covered by insurance, and patients without insurance. 
 
Each hospital’s debt collection policy, among other things, must:   
 
 
provide for active oversight by the hospital of any contract for collection of debts 
on behalf of the hospital; 
 
prohibit the hospital from selling any debt; 
 
prohibit the charging of interest on bills incurred by self-pay patients, as specified; 
 
describe the hospital’s procedures for collecting a debt; 
 
provide a mechanism for a patient to file with the hospital a complaint against the 
hospital or a debt collector used by the hospital; and 
 
prohibit the hospital from collecting additional fees in an amount that exceeds the 
approved charge for the hospital service as established by HSCRC for which the 
medical debt is owed on a bill for a patient who is eligible for free or reduced-cost 
care under the hospital’s financial assistance policy. 
 
For at least 180 days after issuing an initial patient bill, a hospital may not report adverse 
information about a patient to a consumer reporting agency or commence civil action 
against a patient for nonpayment. A hospital must report the fulfillment of a patient’s 
payment obligation within 60 days after the obligation is fulfilled to any consumer 
reporting agency to which the hospital had reported adverse information about the patient. 
 
A hospital must demonstrate that it attempted, in good faith, to offer a patient a payment 
plan that complies with HSCRC guidelines before the hospital files an action to collect a 
debt owed by a patient or delegates collection activity to a debt collector. A hospital is not 
prohibited from using an eligibility vendor to provide outreach to a patient for purposes of 
assisting the patient in qualifying for financial assistance. A hospital may not report adverse 
information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a patient who was uninsured or 
eligible for free or reduced-cost care at the time of service.

HB 1020/ Page 4 
A hospital may not report adverse information about a patient to a consumer reporting 
agency, commence a civil action against a patient for nonpayment, or delegate collection 
activity to a debt collector if (1) the hospital was notified in accordance with federal law 
by the patient or an insurance carrier that an appeal or a review of a health insurance 
decision is pending within the immediately preceding 60 days or (2) the hospital has 
completed a requested reconsideration of the denial of free or reduced-cost care that was 
appropriately completed by the patient within the immediately preceding 60 days. If 
adverse information about a patient has been reported to a consumer reporting agency, the 
hospital must instruct the agency to delete the information if one of these criteria is met. 
Also, for at least 180 days after issuing an initial patient bill, a hospital may not report 
adverse information about a patient to a consumer reporting agency or commence civil 
action against a patient for nonpayment, regardless of whether the hospital can document 
the lack of cooperation of the patient (or the guarantor of the patient) in providing 
information needed to determine the patient’s obligation with regard to the hospital bill. 
 
At least 45 days before filing an action against a patient to collect on the debt owed, a 
hospital must send the patient written notice of the intent to file an action. The notice 
required must (1) be sent to the patient by certified mail and first-class mail; (2) be in 
simplified language; (3) include specified contact and procedural information; and 
(4) be provided in the patient’s preferred language or another language, as specified. The 
notice must be accompanied by (1) an application for financial assistance under the 
hospital’s financial assistance policy and instructions for completing the application; 
(2) the availability of a payment plan to satisfy the medical debt; and (3) a specified 
information sheet. 
 
A complaint by a hospital in an action to collect a debt must include (1) an affidavit with 
specified information; (2) a copy of the original and most recent hospital bill;  
(3) a statement of the amount due; (4) a copy of the notice of intent to file an action; and  
(5) a copy of the patient’s signed certified mail acknowledgement of receipt of the written 
notice of intent to file an action, if received by the hospital. 
 
If a hospital delegates collection activity to a debt collector, the hospital must require a 
debt collector to, along with the hospital, be jointly and severally responsible for meeting 
the hospital debt collection requirements.
