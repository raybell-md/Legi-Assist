House Bill 2 
(Delegate Boyce, et al.) 
Ways and Means 
Budget and Taxation 
 
Property Taxes - Authority of Counties to Establish a Subclass and Set a Special 
Rate for Vacant and Abandoned Property 
 
 
This bill authorizes Baltimore City and county governments to establish, by law, a subclass 
of real property consisting of vacant lots or improved property cited as vacant and unfit for 
habitation or other authorized use on a housing or building violation notice. Baltimore City 
and county governments are authorized to set a special property tax rate for a vacant lot or 
improved property cited as vacant and unfit for habitation or other authorized use on a 
housing or building violation notice. The bill adds a specified reporting requirement for 
jurisdictions that enact a special property tax rate. The bill takes effect June 1, 2024, and 
applies to taxable years beginning after June 30, 2024. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None. 
  
Local Effect:  County property tax revenues (county governments and Baltimore City) 
may be affected depending on the real property tax rate that is set for vacant and abandoned 
property. Baltimore City and county government reporting requirements can be handled 
with existing resources. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Potential meaningful. Small businesses that own vacant or 
abandoned property may be affected depending on the real property tax rate set by 
Baltimore City or county governments. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Title 8 of the Tax Property Article establishes the methods of property 
valuation and assessments and lists those classifications of property created by the

General Assembly. For assessment purposes, property is divided into two classes:  
real property and personal property. Real property is divided into 11 subclasses and 
personal property is divided into 7 subclasses. The State only imposes a property tax on 
real property, whereas county governments impose separate tax rates for real and 
personal property. State and county governments are not authorized to set separate property 
tax rates among different subclasses of property. 
 
Unlike the State and county governments, municipalities have broader discretion to impose 
property tax rates on different classes of property. Municipalities may impose property 
taxes on those classes of property that it selects to be subject to the municipal property tax. 
In addition, municipalities retain the authority to classify property for local purposes and 
to impose different tax treatment on those classes. Furthermore, municipalities have the 
express power to exempt classes of property from taxation. Moreover, because 
municipalities may select the classes of property to be taxed and may set special rates for 
any class of property that is subject to the municipal property tax, municipalities retain the 
authority to levy different tax rates on selected classes of property. 
 
Several municipalities have established a separate property class for municipal property 
tax purposes, including Luke in Allegany County; Cheverly, College Park, Colmar Manor, 
Cottage City, Forest Heights, Mount Rainier, North Brentwood, and Upper Marlboro in 
Prince George’s County; and Pocomoke City in Worcester County. 
 
Seven of the municipalities in Prince George’s County impose a separate property tax rate 
for commercial real property, and two impose a separate rate for multifamily residential 
dwellings. Luke imposes a higher real property tax rate for commercial and rented 
residential property. Pocomoke City imposes a separate property tax rate for nonowner 
occupied property. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  County property tax revenues (county governments and 
Baltimore City) may be affected depending on the real property tax rate that is set by each 
jurisdiction for specified vacant and abandoned property. For fiscal 2024, the State 
Department of Assessments and Taxation reports that there are 242,361 vacant real 
property accounts statewide, excluding exempt and partially exempt accounts, with a total 
assessed value of $14.1 billion. 
 
As a point of reference, Exhibit 1 shows the estimated taxable real property assessable 
base for fiscal 2025 and the revenue generated by a $0.01 increase in county real property 
tax rates.
