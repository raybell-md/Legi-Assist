   (iii) 1. If an eligible customer –generator elects to accrue net 27 
excess generation for a period not to exceed 12 months under subparagraph (i)1 of this 28 
paragraph, the dollar value of net excess generation shall be equal to the generation or 29 
commodity portion of the rate that the eligible customer –generator would have been 30 
charged by the electric company averaged over the previous 12 –month period ending with 31 
the billing cycle that is complete immediately before the end of April multiplied by the 32 
number of kilowatt –hours of net excess generation.  33 
 
 HOUSE BILL 39  5 
 
     2. For an eligible custom er–generator that elects to accrue 1 
net excess generation under subparagraph (i)1 of this paragraph and is served by a 2 
community choice aggregator or an electricity supplier, the dollar value of the net excess 3 
generation shall be equal to the generation or commodity rate that the customer would 4 
have been charged by the community choice aggregator or electricity supplier multiplied 5 
by the number of kilowatt –hours of net excess generation.  6 
 
   (iv) If an eligible customer –generator elects to accrue net excess 7 
generation for an indefinite period under subparagraph (i)2 of this paragraph:  8 
 
    1. the eligible customer –generator may not elect to switch to 9 
accruing net excess generation under subparagraph (i)1 of this paragraph unless the 10

    2. the electric company shall, within 15 days after an eligible 12 
customer –generator’s account is closed, pay the eligible customer –generator, in accordance 13 
with subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, for any accrued net excess generation remaining 14 
at the time the account is closed.  15 
 
   (v) The Commission shall establish a method for calculating the 16 
value of any accrued net excess generation that a customer –generator elects to accrue for 17 
an indefinite period under subparagraph (i)2 of this paragraph.  18 
 
  (6) (i) If an eligible customer –generator elects to accrue net excess 19 
generation under paragraph (5)(i)1 of this subsection, on or before 30 days after the billing 20 
cycle that is complete immediately prior to the end of April of each year, the  electric 21 
company shall pay the eligible customer –generator for the dollar value of any accrued net 22 
excess generation remaining at the end of the previous 12 –month period ending with the 23 
billing cycle that is complete immediately before the end of April.  24 
 
   (ii) Within 15 days after the date an eligible customer –generator 25 
that elects to accrue net excess generation under paragraph (5)(i)1 of this subsection closes 26 
the eligible customer –generator’s account, the electric company shall pay the eligible 27 
custom er–generator for the dollar value of any accrued net excess generation remaining at 28

eligible customer –generator served by an electric cooperative that serves a population of 31 
less than 250,000 in its distribution territory may choose to be paid for the dollar value of 32 
net excess generation remaining at the end of each month instead of at the end of the 33 
accrual period specified  under paragraph (5)(i)1 of this subsection.  34 
 
   (ii) If an eligible customer –generator chooses to be paid for the dollar 35 
value of net excess generation remaining at the end of each month:  36 
 
    1. the customer –generator may accrue net excess generation 37 
on a monthly basis;  38 
6 HOUSE BILL 39   
 
  
    2. the dollar value of the net excess generation shall be equal 1 
to the generation or commodity portion of the rate that the eligible customer –generator 2 
would have been charged by the electric company for the previous month; and  3 
 
    3. on or before 30 days after the end of each month, the 4 
electric cooperative shall pay the eligible customer –generator for the dollar value of net 5 
excess generation remaining at the end of the previous month.  6 
 
 (g) (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (6),  (7), and (8) of this subsection, the 7 
generating capacity of an electric generating system used by an eligible  8
