Section 9 –1016 and 9 –1021  11 
 Annotated Code of Maryland  12 
 (2021 Replacement Volume and 202 5 Supplement)  13 
 
Preamble  14 
 
 WHEREAS, The Ten Commandments, found in the Bible at Exodus 20:1–17 and 15 
Deuteronomy 5:6 –21, are an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and 16 
legal system of the United States of America and of the State of Maryland; and  17 
 
 WHEREAS, The courts of the United States and various states frequently cite the 18 
Ten Commandments in published decisions; and  19 
 
 WHEREAS, In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that it is permissible to 20 
display the Ten Commandments on government property in Van Orden v. Perry; and  21 
 
 WHEREAS, In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court furth er recognized that the Ten 22 
Commandments “have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal system”, 23 
in American Legion v. American Humanists Association, and the court also ruled that the 24 
2 HOUSE BILL 67   
 
 displaying of the Ten Commandments on public prope rty may have “multiple purposes” 1 
such as “historical significance” and represents a “common cultural heritage”; and  2 
 
 WHEREAS, Recognizing the historical role of the Ten Commandments accords with 3 
our nation’s history and faithfully reflects the understandi ng of the founders of our nation 4 
with respect to the necessity of civic morality to a functional self –government; history 5 
records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, stated that “[w]e 6 
have staked the whole future of our new natio n…upon the capacity of each of ourselves to 7 
govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments”; and  8 
 
 WHEREAS, In order that they may understand and appreciate the basic principles 9 
of the American system of government, the people o f the United States and the State of 10 
Maryland need to identify the Ten Commandments, one of many sources, as influencing 11 
the development of what has become modern law; and  12 
 
 WHEREAS, The placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds 13 
of the M aryland State House would help the people of the United States and the State of 14 
Maryland to know the Ten Commandments as the moral foundation of the law; and  15 
 
 WHEREAS, It is the Legislature’s intent to apply the decision set forth by the U.S. 16 
Supreme Cour t in Van Orden v. Perry, to continue the rich tradition and ensure that the 17 
citizens of our State may understand and appreciate the foundational documents of our 18 
State and national government, and that the placing of a monument to the Ten 19 
Commandments on t he grounds of the Maryland State House would help the people of the 20 
United States and the State of Maryland to recognize the Ten Commandments as the moral 21 
foundation of the law; now, therefore,  22
