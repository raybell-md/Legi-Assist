world; and  17 
 
 WHEREAS, Following a considerable passage of time, former students have a 18 
greater appreciation of higher educational opportunities and may seek to return to the 19

a barrier and hindrance to their academic progress; and  21 
 
 WHEREAS, The purp ose of this section is to provide a mechanism for institutions of 22 
higher education to disregard the records of such students that prevent or impede their 23
