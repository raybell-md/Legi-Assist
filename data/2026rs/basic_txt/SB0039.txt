Section 7.5 –211 and 15 –160 16 
 Annotated Code of Maryland  17 
 (2023 Replacement Volume and  2025 Supplement)  18 
 
Preamble  19 
 
 WHEREAS, The State  has operated certified community behavioral health clinics 20 
(CCBHC)  under limited federal grant funding since 2018, serving thousands of State  21 
residents with integrated mental health and substance use care; a nd 22 
  
 WHEREAS, The CCBHC model has demonstrated improvements in access, care 23 
coordination, health outcomes, and reductions in emergency department utilization and 24 
inpatient stays; and  25 
  
2 SENATE BILL 39   
 
  WHEREAS, The State  must move from a grant –funded pilot approach to  CCBHCs 1 
to a sustainable statewide model with a clear rate methodology, ensuring that behavioral 2 
health providers can continue to deliver high –quality, evidence –based, value –driven care; 3 
and  4 
 
 WHEREAS, Outpatient mental health centers (OMHC ) are a cornerstone of the 5 
State ’s behavioral health system, providing community –based treatment for individuals 6 
with serious mental health conditions; and  7 
 
 WHEREAS, OMHCs are in financial crisis due to inadequate and outdated 8 
reimbursement rates  that fail to reflect the true cost of service delivery, workforce needs, 9 
and compliance requirements; and  10 
 
 WHEREAS, The State  currently lacks a formal, transparent rate –setting 11 
methodology for OMHCs and CCBHCs, leading to inconsistent and unsustainable 12 
reimburs ement practices; and  13 
 
 WHEREAS, The closure of OMHCs, such as in Frederick County, demonstrates the 14 
urgent risk to access and continuity of care across the State if rate inadequacies remain 15 
unaddressed; and  16 
 
 WHEREAS, The General Assembly recognizes the importance of establishing parity 17 
between behavioral health and somatic health services, including through transparent, 18 
cost–driven rate reform; now, therefore,  19
