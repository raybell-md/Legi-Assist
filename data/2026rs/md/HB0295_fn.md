First Reader 
House Bill 295 
(Chair, Ways and Means Committee)(By Request - 
Departmental - Lottery and Gaming Control Agency) 
Ways and Means 
 
 
Gaming - Prohibition on Interactive Games and Revenue From Illegal Markets 
 
 
This departmental bill prohibits a person from operating, conducting, or promoting an 
interactive game in the State. An applicant for, or a person holding, a specified gaming 
license must annually report to the State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission 
(SLGCC) any business relationship with specified others that are known to support, 
operate, conduct, or promote an interactive game in the State. Violators are guilty of a 
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to three years and/or a fine of between 
$10,000 and $100,000 and SLGCC must deny the person’s license application or revoke a 
license held by the person. Additionally, the bill specifies disclosure requirements for 
gaming license applicants and license holders. SLGCC may not issue a license and may 
impose sanctions on a licensee and the licensee’s officers and board members under 
specified circumstances. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General fund expenditures for the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) 
increase by $110,800 in FY 2027. Future years reflect annualization and inflation. General 
fund revenues and expenditures may increase potentially minimally as a result of the bill’s 
penalty provisions.

Small Business Effect:  The State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (SLGCA) has 
determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on small business (attached). The 
Department of Legislative Services concurs with this assessment. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  An interactive game is a game, contest, or promotion that is available on 
the Internet or accessible on a mobile phone, computer terminal, or similar device, utilizes 
multiple currency systems of payment allowing the player to exchange the currency for 
any prize or award or cash or cash equivalents, and simulates casino-style gaming, lottery 
games, or sports wagering. An interactive game does not include a game that solely awards 
noncash prizes.  
 
An applicant or a licensee for specified gaming licenses must submit a disclosure on the 
license application and annually thereafter stating the jurisdictions in which the applicant 
or license holder or any affiliate of the applicant or license holder directly or indirectly 
accepted revenue from the conduct of an interactive game in an illegal interactive gaming 
market. A material misrepresentation or omission on the required disclosure may, in 
SLGCC’s discretion, result in an application’s denial of a license or sanctions on a licensee 
and the licensee’s officers and board members.  
 
SLGCC may not issue specified gaming licenses if the applicant or any of the applicant’s 
affiliates knowingly accepts revenue that is directly or indirectly derived from specified 
sources. Likewise, SLGCC may not allow these licensed persons to commence or continue 
operations if SLGCC determines that the person (or person’s affiliates) knowingly accepts 
revenue that is directly or indirectly derived from specified jurisdictions and may revoke 
the license after notice and opportunity for a hearing as specified.  
 
The requirements of the bill also apply to sports wagering licenses.  
 
Current Law:  The General Assembly may only authorize additional forms or expansion 
of gaming if approved through a referendum by a majority of voters in a general election. 
The State of Maryland has authorized online sports wagering and online fantasy 
competitions. 
 
OAG, SLGCC, the Department of State Police, local law enforcement units, and the court 
must liberally construe the Criminal Law Article relating to gambling and betting to 
prevent prohibited activities. A decision by SLGCC must be the final determination as to 
whether a gaming device being operated in the State is a legal gaming device and is being 
operated in a lawful manner.

Federal Laws 
 
Several federal laws, like the Wire Act, the Illegal Gambling Business Act, and the 
Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, among others, make it illegal to operate or 
financially support unlicensed gambling in the United States. The Federal Trade 
Commission handles complaints related to fraudulent or deceptive business practices, 
including those involving online gambling. Additionally, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation handles complaints related to illegal gaming operators. 
 
Background:  According to an August 2025 report by the American Gaming Association, 
Americans wager more than $550 billion annually on illegal sportsbooks and iGaming 
sites, leading to almost $6.0 billion in lost tax revenue for state governments.  
 
In August 2025, the National Association of Attorneys General wrote a letter to the 
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), addressed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, 
requesting assistance to address the spread of illegal offshore gaming operations across the 
United States. The letter noted that offshore entities routinely operate without proper 
licensure, offer limited or non-existent consumer protections, fail to verify user age, ignore 
state boundaries, and evade taxation obligations. The letter was signed by  
50 Attorney Generals representing states and territories, including Maryland’s. 
 
In DOJ’s response in September 2025, DOJ reported that it is committed to addressing 
illegal offshore gaming operators but also encourages states and localities with the 
resources to aid in addressing them.  
 
Since May 2024, SLGCA has sent 75 cease-and-desist letters to alleged illegal operators. 
 
Appendix – Maryland Gaming provides the status of gaming in Maryland as of 
December 2025. 
 
State Revenues:  General fund revenues may increase potentially minimally as a result of 
the bill’s monetary penalty provisions. The bill likely does not materially increase 
State gaming revenues. 
 
State Expenditures:  SLGCA can likely enforce the bill with existing resources. However, 
as SLGCA increases its investigations, OAG may need to provide assistance on those 
investigations. Thus, general fund expenditures for OAG increase by $110,797 in 
fiscal 2027, which accounts for a 90-day start-up delay from the bill’s July 1, 2026 effective 
date. This estimate reflects the cost of hiring one assistant Attorney General to provide 
guidance and address increased enforcement of illegal gaming expected under the bill. It 
includes a salary, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses.

Chapter 492 of 2020, a constitutional amendment approved by the voters at the 
November 2020 general election, authorized sports and event wagering, contingent upon 
implementation legislation passed by the General Assembly. Chapter 356 of 2021 
implemented sports wagering in the State and provides for regulation of sports wagering 
and fantasy gaming competitions. Chapter 604 of 2025 increased the mobile sports 
wagering tax rate from 15% to 20%. Mobile sports wagering licensees receive 80% of 
mobile sports wagering proceeds, while all other licensees receive 85% of proceeds from

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
TITLE OF BILL:  Gaming - Prohibition on Interactive Games and Revenue From Illegal 
Markets 
 
BILL NUMBER:  HB 295 
 
PREPARED BY:  Jennifer A. Beskid 
 
 
PART A. ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
  X      WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL 
BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
__ WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
 
PART B. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
MLGCA cannot determine the extent of the impact of this change on small business; 
however, the majority of illegal gaming and lottery play occurs outside the State.  If 
enforcement were to be successful, the impact on small businesses is expected to be de 
minimis.
