House Bill 252 
(Chair, Environment and Transportation Committee)(By 
Request - Departmental - Environment) 
Environment and Transportation 
 
 
Environment – Lead Paint Abatement Services – Performance Bond and 
Liability Insurance 
 
 
This departmental bill authorizes regulations adopted by the Maryland Department of the 
Environment (MDE) to carry out the provisions of Subtitle 10 of Title 6 of the Environment 
Article, which governs the accreditation of lead paint abatement services, to include 
requirements for any person accredited by MDE to provide lead abatement services to be 
covered by a reasonable performance bond or reasonable liability insurance. The bill takes 
effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Overall, the bill is not anticipated to materially affect State finances. MDE 
can update regulations, conduct outreach to the regulated community, and enforce the bill’s 
changes using existing budgeted resources. Special fund revenues may increase minimally 
from the application of existing penalty provisions to violations of the bill; the bill is not 
anticipated to materially affect State incarceration costs. The Maryland Insurance 
Administration (MIA) can review rates and policies developed under the bill with existing 
budgeted resources. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect local government finances. 
 
Small Business Effect:  MDE has determined that this bill has a meaningful impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) concurs with this 
assessment, as discussed below.

Analysis 
 
Current Law:   
 
Overview of Maryland’s Lead Poisoning Prevention Program 
 
Chapter 114 of 1994 established the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program within MDE. The 
program serves as the coordinating agency of statewide efforts to eliminate childhood lead 
poisoning. Under Title 6, Subtitle 8 of the Environment Article (Reduction of Lead Risk 
in Housing), MDE assures compliance with mandatory requirements for lead risk reduction 
in rental units built before 1978; maintains a statewide listing of registered and inspected 
units; and provides blood lead surveillance through a registry of test results of all children 
tested in Maryland. The Lead Poisoning Prevention Program also oversees case 
management follow-up by local health departments for children with elevated blood lead 
levels; certifies and enforces performance standards for inspectors and contractors working 
in lead hazard reduction; and performs environmental investigations for lead poisoned 
children. Finally, the program provides oversight for community education to parents, 
tenants, rental property owners, homeowners, and health care providers to enhance their 
role in lead poisoning prevention. 
 
Accreditation Required to Provide Lead Paint Abatement Services  
 
To “provide lead paint abatement services” means to engage in the risk assessment, 
inspection, or abatement of lead‑containing substances. In general, unless a person is 
accredited by MDE, they may not (1) act as a contractor or supervisor of the performance 
of lead paint abatement services; (2) provide training to others who provide lead paint 
abatement services; or (3) engage in the inspection of lead-based paint hazards. 
Accreditation fees (which may not be imposed on State or local governments, their 
employees, or a nonprofit training program) range from $125 to $300. Those fees must be 
deposited in the Lead Accreditation Fund, which is used by MDE for activities that are 
related to processing, monitoring, and regulating the accreditation of lead paint abatement 
services and for program development of these activities. 
 
MDE is required to adopt regulations to carry out the statutory provisions governing the 
accreditation of lead paint abatement services. The regulations may include, among other 
things, specified standards and procedures, including (1) initial and continuing standards 
and procedures for accreditation; (2) standards and procedures for renewal of accreditation; 
and (3) standards and procedures for modification, suspension, or revocation of 
accreditation. MDE’s regulations that govern accreditation and training for lead paint 
abatement services are codified under COMAR 26.16.01.

Enforcement of the Accreditation of Lead Paint Abatement Services Subtitle  
 
A person who violates a statutory or regulatory provision governing the accreditation of 
lead paint abatement services is subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000, with each day 
constituting a separate violation. In addition, a person who knowingly and willfully violates 
such a provision is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to (1) a fine of up to $20,000 for a 
first offense or (2) a fine of up to $25,000 and/or imprisonment for up to two years for a 
second or subsequent offense. Also, a violator is subject to an administrative penalty 
imposed by MDE of up to $25,000 for each violation, not exceeding $100,000 total, with 
each day constituting a separate violation. Any fines or penalties collected must be 
deposited into the Lead Accreditation Fund. 
 
Maryland Insurance Administration  
 
Insurance in the State is regulated by MIA, an independent agency headed by the Insurance 
Commissioner, whom the Governor appoints with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
The administration licenses, examines, and audits insurance companies operating in the 
State; reviews rates and policies; collects premium and retaliatory taxes; licenses 
producers; investigates fraud as well as consumer complaints regarding insurance and 
health plan coverage; and educates the public on insurance matters. 
 
Nearly every individual and business entity in the State (including the State itself, local 
governments, and small businesses) have one or more property and casualty insurance 
policies. 
 
Background:  MDE reports that while Maryland has robust regulations for lead hazard 
reduction, a critical gap remains – the lack of mandatory professional insurance for the 
individuals and companies performing the work. A recent MDE review indicated that a 
Maryland-accredited lead paint inspector was using a device that was not on the list of 
MDE‑approved machines. That review ultimately led to an investigation by the  
Attorney General, charges against the individual for falsifying lead abatement certificates, 
and MDE invalidating 1,400 lead inspection certificates that had been issued by the 
individual. The invalidation of these certificates meant that any tenant‑occupied rental 
properties had to be reinspected for lead paint hazards due to the inspector’s failure to 
comply with standard work practices. 
 
According to MDE, adopting regulations that require an accredited lead paint abatement 
service provider to be covered by a reasonable performance bond or reasonable liability 
insurance ensures that if a professional’s negligence causes harm to a family or damages 
their property, there is a financial mechanism to cover medical expenses, relocation costs, 
and cleanup. In addition, it protects property owners from professional mistakes and bad 
actors; for example, if a lead inspector negligently fails to identify a lead hazard, a

performance bond or liability insurance would cover the financial costs of remediation, 
legal fees, and other damages. 
 
Small Business Effect:  In addition to the effects described in MDE’s attached assessment 
of the bill’s economic impact on small businesses, DLS notes that the bill may safeguard 
property owners (i.e., landlords) from the financial risks associated with fraudulent or 
negligent lead work.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
TITLE OF BILL:  Environment - Lead Paint Abatement Services - Performance Bond 
and Liability Insurance 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB 252 
PREPARED BY: 
Fred Banks, Program Manager, Lead Poisoning Prevention Program  
 
PART A. ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
__ WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
_X_ WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
 
PART B. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
Economic Impact Analysis 
The proposed bill will have a meaningful economic impact on Maryland's small 
businesses that provide lead abatement, risk assessment, and inspection services. This is 
because the bill would impose a new and mandatory cost on these businesses, affecting 
their operational expenses, competition, and potentially discouraging new business 
opportunities. 
 
1. Cost of Providing Goods and Services 
The most direct impact is the new financial burden of purchasing and maintaining 
insurance. While some reputable businesses may already carry this coverage, many small 
businesses, particularly those with limited capital, do not. The bill would require both 
general liability and errors and omissions (E&O) insurance. 
The combined cost of these two types of insurance could be a significant annual expense 
for a small business. As a result, these costs would likely be passed on to consumers in 
the form of higher prices for lead abatement services. 
 
2. Capital Investment, Competition, and Economic Development 
The new financial requirements would affect the competitive landscape and could act as a 
barrier to entry for new small businesses. 
 
Discouraging New Businesses: The upfront and ongoing costs of insurance could 
deter individuals from starting a small lead abatement business. This could limit 
the pool of available professionals and potentially hinder economic development 
in the sector.

HB 252/ Page 6 
 
Encouraging Professionalism: Conversely, this bill would help professionalize 
the industry by establishing a minimum standard for financial responsibility. This 
could create a more level playing field, rewarding businesses that are already 
compliant and financially sound. It also protects ethical businesses from being 
undercut by less scrupulous or uninsured competitors. 
 
3. Effect on the Workforce 
The bill could indirectly affect the workforce by potentially driving some small 
businesses out of the market if they cannot absorb the new costs. This could lead to a 
short-term reduction in the number of available professionals, which would in turn affect 
the availability and cost of services for property owners and the state's lead poisoning 
prevention efforts. However, in the long term, it could lead to a more stable and 
professional workforce.
