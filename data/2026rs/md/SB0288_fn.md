FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
First Reader 
Senate Bill 288 
(Senator McCray) 
Budget and Taxation 
 
 
Transportation - Highway User Revenues Capital Grants - Calculation 
 
 
This bill increases, beginning in fiscal 2027, the amount of funds from the Gasoline and 
Motor Vehicle Revenue Account (GMVRA) that the Maryland Department of 
Transportation (MDOT) must annually provide to local governments through capital 
transportation grants. Specifically, MDOT must provide increased capital transportation 
grants to counties in fiscal 2027 and to Baltimore City, counties, and municipalities 
beginning in fiscal 2028. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Because MDOT’s capital program is fully subscribed, overall Transportation 
Trust Fund (TTF) expenditures are not affected. However, over the five‑year period 
addressed in this fiscal and policy note, relative to current law, the bill requires MDOT to 
redirect an estimated $227.6 million in FY 2027, $324.0 million in FY 2028, 
$332.3 million in FY 2029, $341.6 million in FY 2030, and $351.2 million in FY 2031 to 
local governments. 
  
Local Effect:  Over the five-year period addressed in this fiscal and policy note, relative 
to current law, local government revenues increase (in total) by an estimated $227.6 million 
in FY 2027, $324.0 million in FY 2028, $332.3 million in FY 2029, $341.6 million in 
FY 2030, and $351.2 million in FY 2031. Expenditures are not directly affected. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal or none. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  Under current law, TTF provides local transportation aid 
through GMVRA, and revenues in the account are commonly referred to as highway user 
revenues. Currently, the revenues dedicated to the account include all or some portion of

the motor vehicle fuel tax, vehicle titling tax, vehicle registration fees, short-term vehicle 
rental tax, and State corporate income tax. GMVRA revenues are distributed to local 
governments through capital transportation grants. 
 
The amount of the grants that MDOT must annually provide to local governments from 
GMVRA is based on a statutory formula which was last modified by Chapter 240 of 2022. 
Exhibit 1 shows the distribution of GMVRA revenues required beginning in fiscal 2027 
under both current law and the bill.

State Fiscal Effect:  Altering the GMVRA distribution formula beginning in fiscal 2027 
decreases MDOT’s share of highway user revenues and increases the local share of 
highway user revenues provided through capital transportation grants. 
 
Because MDOT’s capital program is fully subscribed, MDOT must redirect capital funding 
from other projects to provide the additional capital transportation grants to local 
governments. Relative to current law and based on the estimated funds credited to 
GMVRA, the bill requires MDOT to redirect $227.6 million in fiscal 2027, $324.0 million 
in fiscal 2028, $332.3 million in fiscal 2029, $341.6 million in fiscal 2030, and 
$351.2 million in fiscal 2031 (totaling approximately $1.6 billion over the five-year period 
addressed in this fiscal and policy note) to local governments.  
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Over the five-year period addressed in this fiscal and policy note, 
relative to current law, local jurisdictions’ highway user revenues (in total) increase by an

fiscal 2029, $341.6 million in fiscal 2030, and $351.2 million in fiscal 2031. The 
distribution of the increase among Baltimore City, the counties, and municipalities is
