House Bill 291 
(Chair, Ways and Means Committee)(By Request - 
Departmental - Lottery and Gaming Control Agency) 
Ways and Means 
 
 
Sports Wagering Proceeds - Promotional Play Exclusion - Limitation 
 
 
This departmental bill alters the definition of sports wagering proceeds so that sports 
wagering proceeds do not include money given away by a sports wagering licensee as free 
promotional play and used by players to bet on a sporting event during the first full  
fiscal year of operations. After the first full fiscal year of operations, the exclusion of 
promotional play as proceeds may not exceed a percentage, as established by the State 
Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (SLGCC) in regulations, of the total sports 
wagering proceeds retained by the sports wagering facility licensee in the prior fiscal year 
or the total online sports wagering proceeds retained by the mobile sports wagering licensee 
in the prior fiscal year. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None. The bill codifies existing procedure. 
  
Local Effect:  None. 
  
Small Business Effect:  The State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (SLGCA) has 
determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on small business (attached). The 
Department of Legislative Services concurs with this assessment. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law:  SLGCC must regulate sports wagering and the conduct of sports wagering 
to the same extent that SLGCC regulates the operation of video lottery terminals and table 
games. SLGCC must adopt regulations governing sports wagering, including standards,

HB 291/ Page 2 
procedures, and rules that govern the conduct of sports wagering, including the type and 
values of promotional items that may be given away to encourage sports wagering. 
 
Appendix – Maryland Gaming provides the status of gaming in Maryland as of 
December 2025. 
 
Background:  In August 2025, SLGCA proposed a regulation in the Maryland Register to 
lower the cap on the amount of money a mobile sports wagering licensee may give away 
as free promotional play in a fiscal year, from 20% to 5% of total sports wagering proceeds 
that the mobile sports wagering licensee generated in the prior fiscal year (see DLS Control 
No. 25-165P). After the first fiscal year of sports wagering activity, this 5% cap includes 
only mobile sports wagering revenues generated by the licensee. The regulation does not 
change the cap for sports wagering facility licensees but does specify that the 20% cap 
applies to sports wagering facility licensees rather than mere sports wagering licensees. 
 
The fiscal analysis of the regulation stated that promotional play spending for mobile sports 
wagering declined from $211.4 million in fiscal 2023 to $105.8 million in fiscal 2025. 
SLGCA advises that promotional play is typically utilized to attract new players. As the 
sports wagering market matures, there are fewer new players to attract with promotional 
play. Assuming this decline in promotional play spending continues until the mobile sports 
wagering market reaches full maturity, reducing the free promotional play of mobile sports 
wagering spending from 20% to 5% may annually increase general fund revenues by 
approximately $2.0 million and Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund revenues by 
approximately $6.0 million.  
 
However, the actual impact on revenues may be significantly less if mobile sports wagering 
licensees greatly reduce promotional play spending due to that spending being subject to 
gaming taxes. A more meaningful decline in such spending could significantly reduce these 
revenue projections. 
 
As of January 2026, SLGCA has not yet final published the regulation and so the regulation 
is not in effect. SLGCA is authorized to final publish the regulation at any time, but if 
SLGCA does not final publish the regulation by August 2026, the regulation will be 
withdrawn as an operation of law.
