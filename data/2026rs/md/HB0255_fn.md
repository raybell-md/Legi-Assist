Request - Departmental - Natural Resources) 
Environment and Transportation 
 
 
Natural Resources - Pamela J. Kelly Tree-Mendous Maryland Program - 
Alterations 
 
 
This departmental bill alters the stated purpose of the Pamela J. Kelly Tree-Mendous 
Maryland Program, administered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), by 
(1) focusing the program’s purpose on “the advancement of forest health and resilience” 
and (2) expanding the program’s scope to include promotion and maintenance of native 
trees and shrubs (on public lands, community open spaces, school grounds, and 
rights‑of‑way) in addition to the already-authorized planting of native trees and shrubs in 
those spaces.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill only alters the purposes for which existing donated/granted funds 
may be used. The expanded scope of the program under the bill may affect the timing of 
deployment of existing funds, but does not otherwise directly affect State finances.   
  
Local Effect:  None. 
  
Small Business Effect:  DNR has determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services concurs with this 
assessment.

Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 129 of 2012 established the Pamela J. Kelly Tree-Mendous 
Maryland Program in statute for the purpose of planting native trees and shrubs on public 
lands, community open spaces, school grounds, and rights-of-way. The program is funded 
by donations and grants received by DNR. The department is authorized to seek, accept, 
and expend donations and grants for the implementation and administration of the program. 
 
Background:  DNR indicates that the bill improves the department’s ability to deploy 
program funds, enabling the Maryland Forest Service to address forest management needs 
beyond planting and deliver a range of resources in support of statewide forest 
conservation.
