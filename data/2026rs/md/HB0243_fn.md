(Chair, Economic Matters Committee)(By Request - 
Departmental - Planning) 
Economic Matters 
 
 
Land Use - Comprehensive and General Plans - Alteration of Elements 
 
 
This departmental bill modifies and reorganizes the elements that a local jurisdiction must 
include in a comprehensive (or general) plan so that the elements (1) are consistent with 
planning principles established under Chapters 63 and 64 of 2025 (see Current Law) and 
(2) apply consistently across all local jurisdictions. The bill also adds and/or modifies 
certain guidance and requirements applicable to the plans as a whole and to specific 
elements. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) and other State agencies can 
implement with existing resources the bill’s requirements that certain data, assistance, 
and/or review be provided to local jurisdictions’ in their efforts to review and update their 
comprehensive (or general) plans. Revenues are not affected. 
  
Local Effect:  Local government expenditures may increase for some local jurisdictions 
to implement the bill’s requirements, as discussed below. This bill may impose a mandate 
on a unit of local government. 
 
Small Business Effect:  MDP has determined that this bill has a meaningful impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services concurs with this 
assessment.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
New List of Eight Elements (See the bill’s amendments to §§ 1-406 and 3-102 of the Land 
Use Article) 
 
The bill replaces an existing list of 6 required elements that charter counties (and certain 
code counties and Baltimore City - see the discussion of Division I of the Land Use Article 
under Background) must include in their comprehensive (or general) plans, and an existing 
list of 12 elements applicable to other counties’ and municipalities’ comprehensive plans, 
with a new list of 8 required elements applicable to all local jurisdictions’ comprehensive 
(or general) plans, as shown in Exhibit 1. 
 
General Requirements Applicable to Comprehensive Plans (See the bill’s amendments 
to §§ 1-406 and 3-102 and repeal of existing §§ 1-407, 3-103, and 3-110) 
 
The bill establishes certain requirements applicable to comprehensive plans in general:   
 
 
Broad Purpose – A plan must provide goals, objectives, guidelines, standards, and 
strategies for the orderly and balanced future economic, social, physical, environmental, 
and fiscal development of the jurisdiction. 
 
Format and Structure – The planning commission must determine the appropriate format 
and structure of the plan, provided each of the elements are addressed, and determine 
whether to include additional elements. 
 
Content – Each element must (1) include and address all required subelements; (2) be 
informed by relevant existing and anticipated future conditions and State and local plans; 
and (3) identify the needs to be addressed and the goals to be achieved. 
 
Statement of Goals and Objectives, Policies, and Standards – A plan must also include a 
specified “statement of goals and objectives, policies, and standards” that (1) serves as a 
guide for the development and economic and social well-being of the jurisdiction; (2) is 
informed by coordination with adjacent jurisdictions and relevant regulatory authorities; 
and (3) identifies strategies, including appropriate recommended development 
regulations, policies, programs, and other mechanisms, to address the needs and goals of 
the plan. (This requirement is taken partially from an existing “goals and objectives” 
element applicable to certain counties and to municipalities, that is repealed by the bill.)

 Development Regulations, Policies, Programs, and Other Mechanisms – Language under 
the existing development regulations element (repealed by the bill) is moved to these 
general requirements (applicable to the plans broadly), and added to, in order to require 
that development regulations, policies, programs, and other mechanisms included in the 
plan encourage (1) the use of flexible development regulations to promote innovative and 
cost-saving site design, implement the planning principles, and protect the environment 
and (2) within areas designated for growth, promote economic development through the 
use of innovative techniques, and provide for the streamlined review of applications for 
development, including permit review and subdivision plat review. 
 Assistance from the Maryland Department of Planning – The bill also establishes that the 
planning commission for a jurisdiction can request that MDP facilitate State agency 
assistance with available data and analysis, and MDP must provide guidelines on how to 
address the elements and identify best practices to be considered. Within the 
requirements applicable to specific elements, MDP is also required to provide jurisdictions 
with various specified data and assistance.

Current Law:   
 
Comprehensive Plans 
 
State law requires a local jurisdiction to adopt, and periodically review and update, a 
comprehensive (or general) plan, and the jurisdiction’s zoning laws must be consistent with 
the plan. A municipality may be included as part of a county plan if approved by the 
legislative body of the county. At least once every 10 years, a comprehensive plan must be 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 243/ Page 9 
reviewed and, if necessary, revised or amended. Jurisdictions can also develop more 
detailed plans for specific areas within the jurisdiction. 
 
Generally, the planning commission of a local jurisdiction develops the comprehensive 
plan and recommends the plan to the jurisdiction’s legislative body for approval/adoption. 
 
A comprehensive plan must implement the planning principles established by Chapters 63 
and 64 (see below) and include the requirement elements shown further above in Exhibit 1. 
 
Planning Principles 
 
Chapters 63 and 64 replaced 12 existing “visions” – that were required to be implemented 
through a local jurisdiction’s comprehensive plan – with 8 “planning principles”:   
 
(1) 
land – optimize productivity of working landscapes, including farms and forests, 
and fisheries, and prioritize development within population centers that are in 
proximity to existing infrastructure and facilities;  
(2) 
transportation – prioritize transportation networks that create energy efficient, 
affordable, and reliable access to jobs, housing, and services;  
(3) 
housing – enable a mix of quality housing types and affordability options to 
accommodate all who want to live in the State;  
(4) 
economy – allow for adaptive reuse, mixed-use, and context appropriate new 
development that responds to changing markets and innovations;  
(5) 
equity – engage all sectors of the community in plan development to ensure diverse 
voices are heard and the needs of underserved populations are prioritized;  
(6) 
resilience – integrate resiliency measures that will minimize the impacts of rapid 
and unexpected natural- and human-caused threats on communities;  
(7) 
place – provide for public spaces that encourage social interaction and value 
cultural, historical, and natural resources; and  
(8) 
ecology – protect and restore sensitive ecological systems and conserve natural 
resources, including forests, agricultural areas, and waterways.  
 
The planning principles are collectively intended to create sustainable communities and 
protect the environment in order to foster a high quality of life for all residents of the State. 
 
Background:   
 
Modified and Reorganized Elements 
 
MDP indicates that the bill (1) aligns the required elements of the comprehensive plan, 
statewide, with the eight planning principles, providing clarity for local governments 
regarding the content of the comprehensive plan; (2) modernizes the comprehensive 

END OF PAGE 9

START OF PAGE 10
    
HB 243/ Page 10 
planning process to align it with planning best practices (based on a nationwide review of 
state-enabling planning law); and (3) explicitly identifies levels of guidance and support 
from State agencies, led by MDP. 
 
Land Use and Planning – Generally 
 
The regulation of land use in the State, through planning and zoning, is implemented by 
local governments, subject to applicable State law. Planning and zoning authority is 
delegated by the State to local governments primarily under the Land Use Article of the 
Maryland Code and, for certain counties, the Express Powers Act (Title 10 of the Local 
Government Article).  
 
Under State law provisions that govern MDP (Title 5 of the State Finance and Procurement 
Article), the department is required to cooperate with and assist local governments in the 
execution of their planning functions. 
 
Express Powers Act 
 
Under the Express Powers Act, charter and code counties are given broad authority to 
“enact local laws relating to zoning and planning to protect and promote public safety, 
health, morals, and welfare” pursuant to § 10-324 of Local Government Article. 
 
Division I of the Land Use Article (within which the bill’s changes are made) 
 
Most of Division I of the Land Use Article applies only to commission counties and 
municipalities (and any code counties that choose not to exercise the powers related to land 
use in the Express Powers Act). Sections 1-401(a), 1-402(b), and 10-103(a) of the Land 
Use Article establish that only certain provisions of Division I – those listed in §§ 1-401(b) 
and 
10-103(b) 
– 
apply 
to 
charter 
counties 
(including 
Montgomery 
and 
Prince George’s counties), code counties that choose to exercise the powers related to land 
use in the Express Powers Act, and Baltimore City. The provisions of Division I that apply 
to charter counties, those specified code counties, and Baltimore City include (1) Title 1, 
Subtitle 4, Parts II and III, that govern those jurisdictions’ development and 
implementation of a comprehensive plan (but see Title 21, for Montgomery and 
Prince George’s counties) and (2) Title 10, which governs zoning in Baltimore City. 
Comprehensive plan requirements applicable to commission counties, any code counties 
that choose not to exercise the powers related to land use in the Express Powers Act, and 
municipalities are in Title 3 of Division I, and comprehensive plan requirements 
applicable to the Maryland-Washington Regional District (in Montgomery and 
Prince George’s counties) are in Title 21 of Division II. 
 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
HB 243/ Page 11 
Generally, municipalities (other than those within the Maryland-Washington Regional 
District) exercise planning and zoning authority within their territory pursuant to Division I 
of the Land Use Article; however, a small number of municipalities do not exercise 
planning and zoning authority and are instead subject to county land use laws. 
 
“Planning” and “Zoning” 
 
The Supreme Court of Maryland distinguishes “planning” and “zoning” by describing 
planning as focused on the long-term development of a community with respect to land 
use, streets, parks, civic beauty, industrial and commercial undertakings, residential 
developments, and other matters, while zoning is focused on the territorial division of land 
within a jurisdiction and dedication of the divided areas to particular uses (e.g., residential, 
commercial, industrial). See Cnty. Council of Prince George’s Cnty. V. Zimmer Dev. Co., 
444 Md. 490, 505, 520 (2015). “Plans are developed to guide the implementation of land 
use controls and zoning in a rational way that is beneficial to the public.” Id. At 520. 
 
The Supreme Court of Maryland indicated in Mayor & Council of Rockville v. Rylyns 
Enters. that comprehensive plans have repeatedly been considered by the court as 
“advisory in nature and hav[ing] no force of law absent statutes or local ordinances linking 
planning and zoning. Where the latter exist, however, they serve to elevate the status of 
comprehensive plans to the level of true regulatory device." 372 Md. 514, 530-531 (2001). 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Local government expenditures may increase in some jurisdictions 
to incorporate the bill’s modified and reorganized comprehensive plan elements in their 
comprehensive planning processes (undertaken under existing law at least every 10 years). 
Any increased work associated with conforming jurisdictions’ comprehensive plans with 
the new elements (and their required content) may be absorbed by jurisdictions that have 
sufficient permanent planning staff but may result in increased costs for jurisdictions that 
(1) rely on contractual services or supplemental staff to undertake their comprehensive plan 
review at least once every 10 years (or that will need to as a result of this bill) and (2) for 
whom assistance from MDP or other agencies does not fully cover additional work during 
the comprehensive planning process resulting from the bill. MDP indicates that the bill 
does not require local jurisdictions to review and update their comprehensive plans to 
conform to the new elements earlier than they otherwise would in accordance with the 
current 10‑year review requirement. 
 
While some local jurisdictions may incur increased costs to update their comprehensive 
plans when they are next reviewed, the bill’s modification and expansion of the required 
content of comprehensive plans is assumed to not have a direct impact on costs of 
government services or infrastructure addressed in the plan. As discussed above (under 
Background), comprehensive plans are considered advisory in nature. As stated in the bill, 

END OF PAGE 11

START OF PAGE 12
    
HB 243/ Page 12 
the comprehensive plan provides “goals, objectives, guidelines, standards, and strategies” 
for the development of the jurisdiction.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL: 
Land Use - Comprehensive and General Plans - Alteration of Elements 
 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB 243 
 
PREPARED BY: 
Andrew Wilson, MDP Government Affairs Specialist 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
__ 
WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
 
   X    WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
 
 
 
PART B.  ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
This bill aims to make a series of amendments to the Land Use Article surrounding the content 
of comprehensive planning elements and the general provisions of comprehensive plans 
themselves. These updates, from a holistic view, include 1) the insertion of the eight Planning 
Principles established via SB 266/HB 286 of the 2025 Session as their own comprehensive 
planning elements and reorganizing previous elements as sub-elements, 2) adds a requirement of 
the Department of Planning to provide local jurisdictions with guidance and support in 
accordance with the adoption and implementation to each element and sub-element, and 3) 
codify general provisions locally adopted comprehensive plans shall satisfy.  
Collectively, these updates modernize the comprehensive planning process to align it 
with planning best practices and charges MDP, in consultation with other state agencies, to 
provide guidance and support to local jurisdictions as they amend and adopt comprehensive 
plans. The intended result of these changes is to produce sounder, more robust comprehensive 
plans which properly prepare a locality for growth, economic and societal shifts, and also 
improve their ability to meet their goals. Local businesses will experience a positive economic 
impact as the implementation of comprehensive plans with these aligned elements will help 
boost local economic health, lower the cost-of-living burden, and promote the development of 
multiple transportation modalities.
