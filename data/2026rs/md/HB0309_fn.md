House Bill 309 
(Delegate Stewart) 
Judiciary 
 
 
Judicial Facilities - Stops, Detentions, and Arrests - Limitations 
 
 
This bill, with specified exceptions, prohibits a “person” from stopping, detaining, or 
arresting an individual for an alleged or adjudicated offense that is subject only to a civil 
penalty while the individual is in a “judicial facility” or is traveling within one mile of a 
judicial facility for the purpose of attending a meeting, a hearing, or another official 
proceeding in the facility unless the person (1) provides prior notice to the presiding judge 
or court administrator and (2) makes the stop, detention, or arrest in a manner that does not 
disrupt proceedings or deter access to justice by any individual. Evidence obtained as a 
result of a violation of the bill’s provisions is inadmissible against the individual stopped, 
detained, or arrested in any proceeding over which a State court or State or local entity has 
jurisdiction. An individual stopped, detained, or arrested in violation of the bill’s provisions 
may bring an action against a person responsible, and the court may award damages, 
injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and court costs. The Attorney General may bring a 
civil action to enjoin a person from committing a violation of the bill’s provisions. Further, 
the bill states that it is the intention of the General Assembly that the bill must supplement 
the protections provided under Chapter 718 of 2025.

“Judicial facility” means a courthouse, an administrative hearing facility, or other location

or quasi-judicial proceedings. “Judicial facility” includes any pathway, hallway, parking 
lot or structure, grounds, or other area within 1,000 feet of a courthouse, an administrative 
hearing facility, or other location used for judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. 
 
“Person” includes a law enforcement agency, law enforcement officer, and any other

Current Law:  Chapter 718 of 2025 requires (1) a federal law enforcement officer to notify 
specified individuals regarding a federal immigration enforcement action at a “sensitive 
location” and (2) a public school, a public library, or a unit of the Executive Branch of 
State or local government that operates at a sensitive location to deny access to any portion 
of the sensitive location that is not accessible to the general public to any individual seeking 
to enforce federal immigration law, unless the individual presents a valid judicial warrant 
or exigent circumstances exist (without applicability to a State or local correctional facility 
or a detention facility in a District Court or circuit court location). 
 
Attorney General Guidance:  Chapter 718 also requires the Attorney General to develop 
and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant State agencies about:   
 
 
delineating between immigration enforcement within the public portions of 
sensitive locations and the nonpublic or private portions of sensitive locations;

immigration enforcement documentation seeking specific individuals; 
 
limiting liability exposure for State, local, and private institutions and the 
participation of the employees of those institutions in immigration enforcement at 
sensitive locations; 
 
facilitating relationships between federal law enforcement officers and State and 
local officials and law enforcement officers in order to conduct immigration 
enforcement activities through the least dangerous and disruptive means; and 
 
complying with existing legal obligations and limitations on State and local agencies 
while maintaining public safety and accessibility to those agencies. 
 
Private entities are encouraged to adopt policies consistent with the guidance developed by 
the Attorney General if the private entities provide services related to (1) physical or 
mental health; (2) education; (3) shelter care; or (4) access to justice. 
 
The required guidance and policies are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act 
under Title 10, Subtitles 1, 2, and 3 of the State Government Article. 
 
Governmental Entity Procedures:  Pursuant to Chapter 718, each public school, public 
library, and unit of the Executive Branch of State or local government that operates a 
sensitive location must implement a policy consistent with the guidance issued by the 
Attorney General. 
 
By July 1, 2026, each governmental entity must (1) in consultation with the Department of 
Information Technology, develop and publish procedures that prevent the sale and 
redisclosure of personal records and geolocation data provided or made available by the 
governmental entity in a way that harms the privacy of residents of the State and (2) submit 
a copy of the procedures developed to the General Assembly. The procedures must 
specifically address:   
 
 
any possible contractual limitations on the sale or redisclosure of personal records 
or geolocation data that a governmental entity may place on a person who receives 
personal records or geolocation data that are provided or made available by the 
governmental entity; 
 
considerations regarding (1) the threat to privacy posed by data brokers who utilize 
personal records or geolocation data for commercial purposes; (2) the risk that 
personal records or geolocation data may be used for purposes other than the 
purposes for which the personal records or geolocation data were developed or 
collected; and (3) geolocation, genetic, and other sensitive data; and
