1 Article – Natural Resources

2 8–1808.

3 (d) (1) In this subsection, “unwarranted hardship” means that, without a
4 variance, an applicant would be denied reasonable and significant use of the entire parcel
5 or lot for which the variance is requested.

6 (3) (i) A local jurisdiction shall process an application for a variance
7 regarding a parcel or lot that is subject to a current violation of this subtitle, a regulation
8 adopted under the authority of this subtitle, or any provision of an order, permit, plan, or
9 local program in accordance with subsection (c)(1)(iii)15 of this section.

10 (ii) In considering an application for a variance, a local jurisdiction
11 shall presume that the specific development activity in the critical area that is subject to
12 the application and for which a variance is required does not conform with the general
13 purpose and intent of this subtitle, regulations adopted under this subtitle, and the
14 requirements of the local jurisdiction’s program.

15 (iii) If the variance request is based on conditions or circumstances
16 that are the result of actions by the applicant, a local jurisdiction shall consider that fact.

17 (IV) WHEN REQUESTING A VARIANCE FOR A NEW ACCESSORY
18 STRUCTURE OR USE, A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION EXISTS THAT AN EXISTING
19 ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE ON THE PARCEL OR LOT DEMONSTRATES
20 REASONABLE AND SIGNIFICANT USE.

21 (V) A LOCAL JURISDICTION MAY NOT ACCEPT AN APPLICATION
22 FOR A VARIANCE TO:

23 1. AUTHORIZE A USE THAT IS NOT ALLOWED BY THE
24 CRITICAL AREA LAND CLASSIFICATION OF THE LOT OR PARCEL;

25 2. ADJUST THE AMOUNT OR TYPE OF MITIGATION
26 REQUIRED BY CRITICAL AREA REGULATIONS OR A LOCAL CRITICAL AREA PROGRAM;
27 OR

28 3. PROVIDE RELIEF THAT COULD BE OBTAINED
29 THROUGH AN AVAILABLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT IS APPROVED AS PART
30 OF A LOCAL JURISDICTION’S CRITICAL AREA PROGRAM.
