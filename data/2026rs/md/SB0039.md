21 (CCBHC) under limited federal grant funding since 2018, serving thousands of State

2 SENATE BILL 39

1 WHEREAS, The State must move from a grant–funded pilot approach to CCBHCs
2 to a sustainable statewide model with a clear rate methodology, ensuring that behavioral
3 health providers can continue to deliver high–quality, evidence–based, value–driven care;
4 and

5 WHEREAS, Outpatient mental health centers (OMHC) are a cornerstone of the
6 State’s behavioral health system, providing community–based treatment for individuals
7 with serious mental health conditions; and

8 WHEREAS, OMHCs are in financial crisis due to inadequate and outdated
9 reimbursement rates that fail to reflect the true cost of service delivery, workforce needs,
10 and compliance requirements; and

11 WHEREAS, The State currently lacks a formal, transparent rate–setting
12 methodology for OMHCs and CCBHCs, leading to inconsistent and unsustainable
13 reimbursement practices; and

14 WHEREAS, The closure of OMHCs, such as in Frederick County, demonstrates the
15 urgent risk to access and continuity of care across the State if rate inadequacies remain
16 unaddressed; and

17 WHEREAS, The General Assembly recognizes the importance of establishing parity
18 between behavioral health and somatic health services, including through transparent,
19 cost–driven rate reform; now, therefore,

20 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
21 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
