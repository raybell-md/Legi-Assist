1 WHEREAS, Charlie Kirk’s commitment to civil discussion and debate stood as a
2 model for young Americans across the political spectrum, and he worked tirelessly to
3 promote unity without compromising on conviction; and

4 WHEREAS, The assassination of Charlie Kirk was not only a heinous act of violence,
5 but a sobering reminder of the growing threat posed by political extremism and hatred in
6 our society; and

7 WHEREAS, Such acts of politically motivated violence are antithetical to the
8 principles of a free republic, in which differences of opinion are to be debated – not silenced
9 – with civility, reason, and mutual respect; and

10 WHEREAS, The rise in targeted violence against individuals for their political
11 beliefs undermines the very fabric of our constitutional democracy and chills the free
12 exchange of ideas essential to a healthy civic society; and

13 WHEREAS, Leaders at every level – government, education, media, and beyond –
14 must stand united in unequivocal condemnation of political violence, regardless of their
15 ideology; and

16 WHEREAS, The tragic loss of Charlie Kirk must not be allowed to deepen the divides
17 in our Nation, but instead serve as a turning point to recommit ourselves to better angels
18 and to the timeless American principles of liberty governed by truth and the virtues of
19 peaceful dialogue; and

20 WHEREAS, Charlie Kirk would not have us respond to his death with despair, but
21 rather with renewed purpose – to speak truth with courage, to stand firm in faith, to seek
22 unity while standing firm in principle, and to serve as living reminders of the values he
23 championed: faith, family, and freedom; now, therefore, be it

24 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That the General
25 Assembly condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of Charles “Charlie”
26 James Kirk and all forms of political violence; and be it further

27 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly commends and honors the dedicated law
28 enforcement and emergency personnel for their tireless efforts in finding the suspect

30 justice to the suspect; and be it further

32 sympathies to Charlie Kirk’s family, including his wife, Erika, and their two young
33 children, and prays for comfort, peace, and healing in this time of unspeakable loss; and be
