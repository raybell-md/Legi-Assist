ownership of its property; however, a disaffiliating local church must reimburse UMC for 
financial investments made by UMC for the acquisition, maintenance, or improvement of

 
may not include any amounts attributable to financial investments for the 
acquisition, maintenance, or renovation of real property made by the disaffiliating 
local church. 
 
Current Law:  All assets owned by any Methodist Church, including those specified, 
whether incorporated, unincorporated, or abandoned are (1) held by the trustees of the 
church in trust for the United Methodist Church and (2) subject to the discipline, usage, 
and ministerial appointments of the United Methodist Church, as from time to time 
authorized and declared by the general conference of that church. 
 
The absence of a trust clause in any deed or other conveyance executed before 
June 1, 1953, does not relieve a local church from its Methodist connectional 
responsibilities and does not absolve a local congregation or board of trustees of its 
responsibility to the United Methodist Church, if such an intent of the founders or the later 
congregations and boards of trustees is indicated by:   
 
 
the conveyance of the assets to the trustees of the local church or any of its 
predecessors; 
 
the use of the name, customs, and polity of the United Methodist Church in such a 
way as to be known to the community as part of this denomination; or 
 
the acceptance of the pastorate of ministers appointed by a bishop of the 
United Methodist Church or employed by the superintendent of the district in which 
the local church is located.
