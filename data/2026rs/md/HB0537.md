19 in a cooperative housing corporation, and lot owners in a homeowners association
20 (hereinafter, collectively, “residential owners”) and the governing bodies of such
21 communities, and that identifying and establishing a bill of rights for those residential
22 owners is an important objective; and

23 WHEREAS, The Uniform Law Commission recognized the need for a bill of rights
24 for residential owners and first approved a model bill of rights in 2008 for consideration by

1 WHEREAS, The Task Force completed its work in 2006, before the Uniform Law
2 Commission approved its first model bill of rights, and therefore the Task Force concluded
3 in its Final Report of December 31, 2006, that it would be prudent to wait on a final proposal
4 for a Maryland Bill of Rights until the model Uniform Law Commission Bill of Rights was
5 made available to the states; and

6 WHEREAS, The Task Force was informally reestablished during 2021 and diligently
7 drafted an updated bill of rights from the Uniform Law Commission, the Montgomery
8 County Commission on Common Ownership Communities, the Maryland Homeowners
9 Association, and other relevant sources; now, therefore,
