House Bill 310 
(Delegate Kaufman, et al.) 
Judiciary 
 
 
Correctional Services - Restrictive Housing - Individuals With Developmental or 
Intellectual Disabilities 
 
 
This bill authorizes an applicable “clinical professional,” during the intake assessment for 
a new incarcerated individual, to assess the incarcerated individual for a “developmental 
disability” or an “intellectual disability.” Based on the assessment, the clinical professional 
may recommend to the correctional facility that the incarcerated individual should not be 
placed in “restrictive housing” for more than 15 consecutive days in a 30-day period. If a 
clinical professional makes such a recommendation, the correctional facility may not place 
an incarcerated individual in restrictive housing for more than 15 consecutive days in a  
30-day period. This limit on restrictive housing does not apply to an incarcerated individual 
who commits a “prohibited act.” The bill’s provisions only apply to a State correctional 
facility.

“Developmental disability” means a severe chronic disability of an individual that: 
 
 
is attributable to a physical or mental impairment, other than the sole diagnosis of 
mental illness, or to a combination of mental and physical impairments; 
 
is manifested before the individual attains the age of 22; 
 
is likely to continue indefinitely; 
 
results in an inability to live independently without external support or continuing 
and regular assistance; and 
 
reflects the need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or 
generic care, treatment, or other services that are individually planned and 
coordinated for the individual. 
 
“Intellectual disability” means a developmental disability that is evidenced by significantly 
subaverage intellectual functioning and impairment in the adaptive behavior of an 
individual. 
 
“Prohibited act” includes: 
 
 
causing or attempting to cause serious physical injury to or death of another person; 
 
making an imminent threat of serious physical injury or death to another person 
when (1) the individual making the threat has a history of causing physical injury or 
death and (2) the Commissioner of Correction reasonably determines that there is a 
strong likelihood that the person will carry out a threat of serious physical injury or 
death; 
 
compelling or attempting to compel another person, by force or threat of force, to 
engage in a sexual act; 
 
extorting another, by force or threat of force, for property or money; 
 
coercing another, by force or threat of force, to violate a rule; 
 
leading, organizing, inciting, or attempting to cause a riot, an insurrection, or any 
other similarly serious disturbance that results in the taking of a hostage, major 
property damage, or physical harm to another person; 
 
procuring deadly weapons or other dangerous contraband that pose a serious threat 
to the security of the institution; and 
 
escaping, attempting to escape, or facilitating an escape from a correctional facility 
or escaping or attempting to escape while under supervision outside a correctional 
facility. 
 
“Restrictive housing” means a form of physical separation that has not been requested by 
the incarcerated individual in which the incarcerated individual is placed in a locked room 
or cell for approximately 22 hours or more out of a 24-hour period. “Restrictive housing”

includes administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation. “Restrictive housing” 
does not include (1) medical isolation; (2) mental-health observation or crisis stabilization; 
(3) suicide watch; (4) protective custody requested by the incarcerated individual; or  
(5) quarantine or public-health isolation. 
 
Current Law:  DPSCS is authorized to adopt regulations for the operation and 
maintenance of State correctional facilities, including regulations concerning the discipline 
and conduct of incarcerated individuals and the character of punishments for violations of 
discipline. 
 
By regulation, the managing official of a correctional facility must maintain a written 
policy and procedure governing the placement, removal, supervision, and rights of an 
incarcerated individual assigned to “administrative segregation,” “disciplinary detention,” 
medical isolation, and protective custody status, which includes provisions for 
(1) identification of persons authorized to place and remove an incarcerated individual 
from special confinement; (2) designation of circumstances and conditions warranting 
assignment and release; (3) specification of timeframes, method, and persons authorized to 
review status; (4) access to services, programs, and activities consistent with the 
incarcerated individual’s status; and (5) maintenance of supervision records of specified 
activities and occurrences. 
 
“Administrative segregation” means a form of physical separation of an incarcerated 
individual from the general population determined by the classification process or 
authorized personnel when the continued presence of an incarcerated individual in the 
general population would pose a serious threat to (1) life; (2) property; (3) self; (4) staff or 
other incarcerated individuals; (5) the security or orderly functioning of the facility; or 
(6) the well-being of society. “Disciplinary detention” means a form of physical separation 
in which an incarcerated individual found guilty at a disciplinary hearing is confined apart 
from the general population for a designated period of time. 
 
DPSCS regulations also address discipline of incarcerated individuals. An incarcerated 
individual who commits a rule violation is subject to the incarcerated individual 
disciplinary process of the department. Sanctions for incarcerated individual rule violations 
include (1) placement of an incarcerated individual on disciplinary segregation; 
(2) revocation of good conduct and special projects credits; (3) suspension of incarcerated 
individual privileges; or (4) restitution for lost, stolen, altered, damaged, or destroyed 
property of the State, a person, or an entity. Rule violations are categorized according to 
the severity of the offense. When staff believe a rule violation has occurred, an 
investigation is initiated within one calendar day of the alleged violation, and a shift 
supervisor determines whether the violation merits a hearing, informal disposition, or 
reduction to an incident report. Staff serves a notice of incarcerated individual rule 
violation and disciplinary hearing on the incarcerated individual, and a shift commander

may isolate the incarcerated individual if the incarcerated individual poses a threat to 
security. 
 
Following a hearing, and upon a determination of guilt, a hearing officer may permit the 
defendant incarcerated individual or, if represented, the defendant incarcerated individual’s 
representative and, if assigned, the facility representative, to argue for appropriate 
sanctions. The hearing officer also (1) determines and imposes appropriate sanctions in 
regard to disciplinary segregation time and loss of diminution credits according to an 
adjustment history sentencing matrix and (2) informs the hearing participants of the 
sanction imposed and the period and effective date of the sanction. The standard of proof 
required for the administrative process is “substantial evidence.” “Substantial evidence” 
means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a 
conclusion. 
 
To the extent possible, the Commissioner of Correction may not prohibit an incarcerated 
individual placed in restrictive housing from having access to a reentry specialist or case 
manager within 180 days before the incarcerated individual is released to the community. 
 
Chapter 324 of 2019 prohibits, with specified exceptions, the involuntary placement of a 
pregnant incarcerated individual in restrictive housing and sets forth requirements for when 
a pregnant incarcerated individual is placed in restrictive housing. Each correctional 
facility must have a written policy in place regarding the medical care of pregnant 
incarcerated individuals that addresses the use of involuntary medical isolation or 
restrictive housing for administrative, protective, or disciplinary purposes during 
pregnancy and eight weeks during the postpartum or post-pregnancy recovery period. 
 
Chapter 526 of 2019 prohibits the placement of a minor in restrictive housing unless the 
managing official of the facility finds by clear and convincing evidence that there is an 
immediate and substantial risk of physical harm to the minor, other incarcerated 
individuals, or staff or to the security of the facility. 
 
By December 31 each year, each correctional unit must submit data to the Governor’s 
Office of Crime Prevention and Policy (GOCPP) showing, by correctional unit: 
 
 
the total population of the correctional unit; 
 
the number of incarcerated individuals who have been placed in restrictive housing 
during the preceding year by age, race, gender, classification of housing, and the 
basis for the incarcerated individual’s placement in restrictive housing; 
 
the number of incarcerated individuals with serious mental illness that were placed 
in restrictive housing during the preceding year and the definition of “serious mental 
illness” used by the unit in making the report;

HB 310/ Page 5 
 
the number of incarcerated individuals known to be pregnant when placed in 
restrictive housing during the preceding year; 
 
the average and median lengths of stay in restrictive housing of the incarcerated 
individuals placed in restrictive housing during the preceding year; 
 
the number of incidents of death, self-harm, and attempts at self-harm by 
incarcerated individuals in restrictive housing during the preceding year; 
 
the number of incarcerated individuals released from restrictive housing directly 
into the community during the preceding year; 
 
any other data the correctional unit considers relevant to the use of restrictive 
housing by correctional facilities in the State; and 
 
any changes to written policies or procedures at each correctional unit relating to 
the use and conditions of restrictive housing, including steps to reduce reliance on 
restrictive housing. 
 
GOCPP must make the submitted information available on its website and, as specified, 
submit the information in a report to the General Assembly. 
 
“Restrictive housing” means a form of physical separation that has not been requested by 
the incarcerated individual in which the incarcerated individual is placed in a locked room 
or cell for approximately 22 hours or more out of a 24-hour period and includes 
administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation. The definition applies to both 
State and local correctional facilities.
