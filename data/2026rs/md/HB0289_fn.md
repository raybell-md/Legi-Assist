Departmental - Lottery and Gaming Control Agency) 
Ways and Means 
 
 
Video Lottery Facility Payouts - Intercepts for Restitution Payments, Child 
Support Payments, and Debts Owed to the State 
 
   
This departmental bill authorizes the Central Collection Unit (CCU) to certify a debt or 
claim owed to the State, and the responsible debtor, to a video lottery operator for prize 
interception. The bill specifies the order in which specified interception requests must be 
honored and makes clarifying changes. The Secretary of the Department of Budget and 
Management (DBM) and the Director of the State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency 
(SLGCA) may jointly adopt regulations to implement provisions of the bill. The bill takes 
effect July 1, 2026.   
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  State revenues (all funds) and special fund revenues annually increase, 
potentially by at least $3.0 million and $510,000, respectively, beginning in FY 2027 from 
prize interceptions. Affected State agencies can implement the bill with existing resources.

assessment. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Intercept Program for CCU State Debts or Claims 
 
Certification of the debt or claim owed to the State that CCU sends to the video lottery 
operator must contain specified information. If the debtor wins a prize to be paid directly 
by a video lottery operator, the video lottery operator must notify the debtor that State law 
requires the operator to withhold the prize and pay it toward money owed to the State. The 
bill establishes an appeal process available to those receiving the notice. If an appeal is not 
filed within 15 days after the date of the notice, the video lottery operator must transfer the 
prize, up to the amount of the debt or claim, to CCU. The video lottery operator must honor 
prize interception requests in the following order:   
 
(1) 
child support payments that are in arrears;  
(2) 
restitution for delinquency or a crime that is in arrears; and  
(3) 
debts or claims owed to the State. 
 
Restitution Payment Intercept Program 
 
The bill authorizes CCU to collect overdue restitution and certify a restitution obligor who 
is in arrears on payments exceeding $30 to a video lottery operator (instead of SLGCA) for 
video lottery facility prize interception, and makes conforming changes. SLGCA advises 
that this codifies existing procedure. 
 
Child Support Intercept Program 
 
The Child Support Administration (CSA) within the Department of Human Services is 
authorized to certify under certain conditions unpaid child support debts of more than $150 
to SLGCA or a video lottery operator (instead of just SLGCA as under current law). The 
bill also makes technical and conforming changes. SLGCA advises that these changes 
codify existing procedure. 
 
Current Law:  While State law requires video lottery operators to intercept prize money 
for outstanding child support obligations and delinquent court-ordered restitution, it does 
not authorize intercepting outstanding debts owed to the State.

HB 289/ Page 3 
SLGCA must intercept lottery prize winnings for outstanding child support collected by 
CSA, delinquent court-ordered restitution, and other debt owed to the State collected by 
CCU. 
 
Intercept Programs to Collect Delinquent Child Support 
 
The State operates several intercept programs to collect delinquent child support, including 
lottery prizes and prizes won at a video lottery facility, among others. Pursuant to the 
Family Law Article, CSA is authorized to certify under certain conditions unpaid child 
support debts of more than $150 to SLGCA. SLGCA and a video lottery operator are 
required to remit to CSA the prize up to the amount of arrearage of an obligor certified as 
being in arrears. 
 
Restitution Payments  
 
The Division of Parole and Probation and the Department of Juvenile Services may refer 
an overdue restitution account for collection to CCU and, if probation or other supervision 
is terminated and restitution is still owed, must refer the overdue restitution account for 
collection to CCU. 
 
CCU may collect overdue restitution and certify a restitution obligor who is in arrears on 
payments exceeding $30 to the Comptroller for income tax refund interception and to 
SLGCA for State lottery prize and video lottery facility prize interception. SLGCA and a 
video lottery operator are required to remit to CCU the prize up to the amount of arrearage 
of an obligor certified as being in arrears. 
 
Central Collection Unit  
 
CCU is responsible for collecting any delinquent accounts or debts owed to the State. CCU 
is authorized to use any actions available to it under State law to collect debts or claims. 
CCU is authorized to charge an administrative fee of up to 20% of the outstanding principal 
and interest on the debt referred to it for collection; the current fee is 17%. Debt payments 
are credited to the agency that refers the debt. The administrative fees are credited to the 
Central Collection Fund, which is the special fund used to pay for CCU’s operating 
expenses. 
 
CCU uses a variety of methods and resources to facilitate the collection of delinquent 
accounts, including intercepting lottery prize money. 
 
Background:  The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) in DLS issued an audit of SLGCA 
in May 2025 that found that State casinos did not intercept prize money for amounts due 
to the State because statute only provides for such recoveries from lottery winnings. 

END OF PAGE 3

HB 289/ Page 4 
Examining three of the six casinos from September 30, 2021, through January 31, 2024, 
the audit identified $9.2 million in prize money awarded to patrons that could have been 
withheld. 
 
CCU is responsible for collecting delinquent debts, claims, and accounts owed to the State 
except for taxes, child support payments, and unemployment contributions and 
overpayments. Typical debts include Motor Vehicle Administration fines; student tuition 
and fees; and restitution for damage to State property. 
 
Appendix – Maryland Gaming provides the status of gaming in Maryland as of 
December 2025. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  Based on OLA’s audit of SLGCA, DLS estimates that State revenues 
(all funds) increase significantly, potentially by at least $3.0 million annually, from 
intercepting video lottery facility prizes for debts and claims owed to the State, which are 
credited to the agency that refers the debt. Since CCU charges a 17% administrative fee, 
special fund revenues to the Central Collection Fund increase, potentially by at least 
$510,000 annually, beginning in fiscal 2027. The actual increase in State revenues depends 
on a casino patron’s winnings and the amount of debts and claims owed to the State by that 
person. 
 
Other Impacts 
 
SLGCA and DBM can adopt regulations and SLGCA can monitor video facility operators’ 
compliance with existing resources. The bill is not anticipated to materially affect the 
operations or finances of the Judiciary. To the extent that there are contested hearings for 
prize intercepts, the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) can likely handle any 
increase in cases with existing resources. Additionally, OAH notes that it needs to train 
administrative law judges on substantive aspects of the bill, which it can do with existing 
resources. 
 
Local Revenues:  Under § 3-302 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, a 
community college is a unit of the State for purposes of CCU. CCU is responsible for the 
collection of each delinquent account or other debt that is owed to a community college if 
the board of trustees for the community college adopts a resolution appointing CCU as the 
collector of delinquent accounts or other debt and submits the resolution to CCU. 
 
Thus, to the extent gaming prizes are intercepted for CCU debts or claims on behalf of 
community colleges, local community college revenues annually increase beginning in 
fiscal 2027. The actual increase depends on a casino patron’s winnings and the amount of 
debt stemming from local community colleges that has been referred to CCU.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL:

Child Support Payments, and Debts Owed to the State 
 
BILL NUMBER:  HB 289 
 
PREPARED BY: 
Jennifer Beskid 
 
 
PART A. ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
X WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
__ WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
 
PART B. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
The proposal is specific to the ability of video lottery operators to be notified about a 
claim or a debt and to intercept winnings that could be applied to the claim or debt in a 
manner similar to how lottery winnings are intercepted. This change will not have an 
impact on small businesses.

Chapter 492 of 2020, a constitutional amendment approved by the voters at the 
November 2020 general election, authorized sports and event wagering, contingent upon 
implementation legislation passed by the General Assembly. Chapter 356 of 2021 
implemented sports wagering in the State and provides for regulation of sports wagering 
and fantasy gaming competitions. Chapter 604 of 2025 increased the mobile sports 
wagering tax rate from 15% to 20%. Mobile sports wagering licensees receive 80% of 
mobile sports wagering proceeds, while all other licensees receive 85% of proceeds from
