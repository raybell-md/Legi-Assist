2 SENATE BILL 265

1 (i) is connected to the electric distribution system serving the State;

2 (ii) is located in the same electric service territory as its subscribers;

3 (iii) is attached to the electric meter of a subscriber or is a separate
4 facility with its own electric meter;

5 (iv) credits its generated electricity, or the value of its generated
6 electricity, to the bills of the subscribers to that system through virtual net energy
7 metering;

8 (v) has at least two subscribers but no limit to the maximum number
9 of subscribers;

10 (vi) does not have subscriptions larger than 200 kilowatts
11 constituting more than 60% of its kilowatt–hour output;

12 (vii) has a generating capacity that does not exceed 5 megawatts as
13 measured by the alternating current rating of the system’s inverter;

14 (viii) may be owned by any person; and

15 (ix) with respect to community solar energy generating systems
16 constructed under the Program, serves at least 40% of its kilowatt–hour output to LMI
17 subscribers unless the solar energy system is wholly owned by the subscribers to the solar
18 energy system.

19 (7) “LMI subscriber” means a subscriber that:

20 (i) is low–income;

21 (ii) is moderate–income; or

22 (iii) resides in a census tract that is:

23 1. an overburdened community; and

24 2. an underserved community.

25 (d) (1) (i) The Commission shall establish and maintain a Community
26 Solar Energy Generating Systems Program.

27 (ii) The structure of the Program is as provided in this subsection.

28 (13) (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a
29 community solar energy generating system may not be located on the same [or an adjacent]

SENATE BILL 265 3

1 parcel of land as an existing or proposed community solar energy generating system if the
2 total installed capacity of all community solar energy generating systems on the [same or
3 adjacent] parcel would exceed 5 megawatts.

4 (ii) The prohibition under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph does
5 not apply to projects constructed:

6 1. on the rooftops of buildings;

7 2. in areas that are zoned for industrial use;

8 3. on brownfields locations and clean fill sites;

9 4. over parking lots or roadways;

10 5. on multilevel parking structures;

11 6. on or over transportation or public rights–of–way;

12 7. at airports;

13 8. on land that:

14 A. was previously zoned for industrial use or is ecologically
15 compromised; and

16 B. is not targeted for mitigation or restoration; or

17 9. in any location if the combined capacity of all community
18 solar energy generating systems on the same [or adjacent] parcel does not exceed 10
19 megawatts and:

20 A. at least 75% of the aggregate capacity of the co–located
21 community solar energy generating systems serves LMI subscribers;

22 B. for a site without a community solar energy generating
23 system installed before the start of the Program under paragraph (20) of this subsection,
24 all of the community solar energy generating systems installed after the start of the
25 Program are used for agrivoltaics; or

26 C. for a site with a community solar energy generating
27 system installed before the start of the Program under paragraph (20) of this subsection,
28 each new community solar energy generating system installed after the start of the
29 Program is used for agrivoltaics.

30 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
31 October 1, 2026.
