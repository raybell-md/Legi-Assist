HB 365/ Page 2 
age 21 may use and possess the personal use amount of cannabis, while the possession of 
the personal use amount of cannabis by a person younger than age 21, as well as the 
possession of the civil use amount of cannabis, are subject to civil penalties. Possession of 
more than the civil use amount of cannabis by anyone is subject to a criminal penalty. 
 
“Personal use amount” means (1) up to 1.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) up to 12 grams 
of concentrated cannabis; (3) cannabis products containing up to 750 milligrams of 
delta‑9‑tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); or (4) up to two cannabis plants. “Civil use amount” 
means (1) more than 1.5 ounces but not more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) more 
than 12 grams but not more than 20 grams of concentrated cannabis; or (3) cannabis 
products containing more than 750 milligrams but not more than 1,250 milligrams of 
delta‑9-THC. 
 
Medical Cannabis 
 
Pursuant to Chapters 254 and 255 of 2023, the Maryland Cannabis Administration is 
responsible for the State’s medical cannabis program, which is intended to make medical 
cannabis available to qualifying patients in a safe and effective manner. There is a 
framework to certify health care providers (including physicians, physician assistants, 
dentists, podiatrists, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives), qualifying patients, and their 
caregivers to provide qualifying patients with medical cannabis legally under State law via 
written certification. Qualifying patients may possess (1) up to 120 grams of usable 
cannabis; (2) cannabis-infused products containing up to 36 grams of delta-9-THC; or 
(3) for a qualifying patient who is at least age 21, no more than four cannabis plants. 
 
Possession of cannabis and medical cannabis remains illegal under federal law.

a juvenile court for an act that would be a disqualifying crime if committed by an 
adult. 
 
In addition, a person is prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm, a rifle, or a shotgun 
if the person was previously convicted of (1) a crime of violence; (2) a violation of specified 
controlled dangerous substances laws; or (3) an offense under the laws of another state or 
the United States that would constitute one of these crimes if committed in this State. 
 
Generally, a violator is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to maximum penalties of 
five years imprisonment and/or $10,000 fine. 
 
Under federal law, a person is prohibited from possession of a firearm if the person:

exceeding 10 years or a $250,000 fine or both. 
 
Handgun Permit 
 
Generally, with certain exceptions, to be issued a handgun permit by the Secretary of State 
Police, an applicant (1) must be at least age 21 or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, the 
National Guard, or the uniformed services; (2) must not have been convicted of a felony or 
misdemeanor for which a sentence of imprisonment for more than one year has been 
imposed or, if convicted, must have been pardoned or been granted relief under federal 
law; (3) must not have been convicted of a controlled dangerous substance violation and 
must not presently be an addict, a habitual user of a controlled dangerous substance, or an 
alcoholic; (4) must not be on supervised probation for conviction of a crime punishable by 
imprisonment for one year or more, a violation of § 21-902(b) or (c) of the Transportation

Article, a current extreme risk protective order has been entered under § 5-601 of the Public 
Safety Article, or any other type of current court order has been entered prohibiting the 
person from purchasing or possessing firearms; (8) must not exhibit a propensity for 
violence or instability, which may reasonably render possession of a handgun a danger to the 
applicant or another; (9) must have successfully completed, prior to application and each 
renewal, a specified firearms training course approved by the Secretary; (10) if younger 
than 30, must not have been committed to a facility for juveniles for longer than one year 
or adjudicated delinquent for a crime of violence, a felony, or misdemeanor that carries a 
statutory penalty of more than two years; and (11) must not otherwise be prohibited by 
State or federal law from possessing a handgun. 
 
State Expenditures:  The Department of State Police (DSP) advises that the firearm 
application, which is now automated, includes a question regarding the use of cannabis. 
DSP further advises that 79 applications for firearms were denied in 2025 due to responses 
to that question on the application. Thus, the system needs to be reprogrammed as a result 
of the bill. Accordingly, general fund expenditures increase by an estimated $100,000 in 
fiscal 2027 only for programming changes.  
 
Additional Comments:  The bill’s changes are inconsistent with provisions of State law 
and may result in a violation of federal law.
