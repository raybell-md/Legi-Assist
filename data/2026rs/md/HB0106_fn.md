State Personnel - Collective Bargaining - Nontenure Track Faculty 
 
 
This bill extends collective bargaining rights to nontenure track faculty at the University 
System of Maryland (USM), Morgan State University (MSU), and St. Mary’s College of 
Maryland (SMCM). The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Expenditures for USM institutions, MSU, and SMCM increase minimally 
to reimburse the Public Employee Relations Board (PERB) for collective bargaining 
expenses. Accordingly, PERB reimbursable revenues and expenditures increase 
minimally. In addition, USM, MSU, and SMCM administrative and personnel 
expenditures may increase, potentially significantly, but any such costs are contingent on 
the outcome of elections and subsequent collective bargaining and, therefore, cannot be 
reliably estimated. 
  
Local Effect:  None. 
  
Small Business Effect:  None. 
  
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  “Nontenure track faculty” means full-time, part-time, or adjunct nontenure 
track employees of a USM institution, MSU, or SMCM whose assignments involve 
academic responsibilities, including teachers, researchers, and department heads and those 
in comparable positions. Nontenure track faculty at each affected institution must have 
their own bargaining unit.

HB 106/ Page 2 
Current Law:  Chapter 341 of 2001 extended collective bargaining rights to many 
categories of higher education personnel at public four-year institutions of higher education 
and Baltimore City Community College but excluded all faculty and students from the 
benefit. In addition, contingent, contractual, temporary, or emergency employees are 
specifically excluded from collective bargaining. Also excluded are student employees, 
including teaching assistants and postdoctoral interns.  
 
University Employment and Compensation Policies 
 
USM institutions must follow various policies related to staff employment and 
compensation. For example, under USM Policy II – 1.05 Policy on the Employment of 
Full-Time, Non-Tenure Track Instructional Faculty in the University System of Maryland 
and USM Policy II – 1.06 Policy on the Employment of Salaried, Part-Time, Non-Tenure 
Track Instructional Faculty in the University System of Maryland, every effort must be 
made to make salaries professionally appropriate and competitive to the extent allowed by 
available fiscal resources.  
 
Wages for graduate assistants are set by each institution. USM institutions must follow 
USM Policy III – 7.11 Policy on Graduate Assistantships. Under this policy, appointments 
may be made for appropriate periods of time, as determined by the institution. A graduate 
assistant may serve on a full-time, half-time, or other basis. A full-time assistant’s 
responsibilities should require, on average, 20 hours per week. A half-time assistantship 
should require an average of 10 hours per week.  
 
According to USM policy, each institution must establish stipend levels for graduate 
assistants that are competitive with peer institutions, to the extent allowed by available 
fiscal resources. Further, each institution must establish minimum stipend amounts 
annually, with discretion to award stipends above the minimum level.  
 
Public Employee Relations Board 
 
The Public Employee Relations Act (Chapter 114 of 2023) substantially restructured 
collective bargaining by public employees, including establishing PERB as the 
replacement for three separate boards – among them the former State Higher Education 
Labor Relations Board – to oversee collective bargaining for all public employees. PERB 
may investigate and take appropriate action in response to complaints of unfair labor 
practices, including strikes and lockouts. The State and its officers, employees, agents, or 
representatives are prohibited from engaging in unfair labor practices. PERB also 
administers elections for exclusive representatives.

Certification of an Employee Organization 
 
In order to be certified, an employee organization must submit a petition showing that at 
least 30% of the eligible employees in a bargaining unit wish to be represented by the 
petitioning organization. Other employee organizations may participate in the election if 
they prove that 10% of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit wish to be represented 
by them. There must also be a provision for “no exclusive representative” on the ballot. 
PERB must conduct the election by secret ballot, which may be in person, by mail, or 
electronic. Interest in union representation can be shown by a union authorization card or 
a union membership card as specified.  
 
An employee organization may request a preferred method of voting; if there is a dispute 
between two or more employee organizations, PERB may designate the method of voting.  
 
PERB must certify as exclusive representative the employee organization receiving the 
votes in an election from a majority of the employees voting in the election.  
 
Office of Administrative Hearings 
 
The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) has been delegated authority by the 
Department of Budget and Management to conduct State Personnel Management System 
hearings, including those involving grievances and disciplinary appeals. OAH has also 
been delegated hearing authority by USM and MSU to hear similar matters.  
 
Consolidated Collective Bargaining Memorandum of Understanding 
 
Consolidated collective bargaining allows an exclusive representative that represents 
multiple bargaining units within USM to negotiate a single consolidated memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) that applies to all represented employees across system institutions. 
Any such MOU covers broad employment terms such as wages, benefits, grievance 
procedures, layoffs, health and safety, union rights, and management rights. However, 
certain institution-specific matters – such as essential employee designation, work hours, 
student breaks, shift differentials, and telework – must be negotiated separately between 
each institution’s president (or designee) and the union. Any additional institution-specific 
issues not explicitly categorized must be negotiated either through mutual agreement at the 
institution level or incorporated into the consolidated MOU if no agreement is reached. 
The MOU aligns with the fiscal year (July 1 – June 30) and remains in effect until replaced 
by a subsequent agreement.

State Fiscal Effect:   
 
Public Employee Relations Board 
 
PERB operates on a reimbursable funding model with respect to public institutions of 
higher education, with each institution paying a per-covered employee fee to PERB for 
operating expenses. Therefore, PERB reimbursable revenues and expenditures increase 
minimally for each election. Actual revenues and expenditures depend on the number of 
elections held, the number of members, and the number and duration of any disputes. PERB 
anticipates increased costs peaking over three fiscal years (fiscal 2027 through 2029) and 
then tapering off; costs include postage for ballots, office supplies, and per diem board 
payments. However, PERB does not anticipate requiring additional staff to implement the 
bill. 
 
Higher Education Institutions 
 
Higher education expenditures increase minimally for USM institutions, MSU, and SMCM 
to reimburse PERB for expenses related to collective bargaining. Actual costs depend on 
whether eligible nontenure track faculty decide to collectively bargain and the actual 
reimbursable costs that can be assigned to the institutions. 
 
Administrative expenditures may increase minimally at USM institutions, MSU, SMCM 
to expand collective bargaining to eligible nontenure track faculty. Several institutions 
advise that additional full-time staff are necessary, although most do not specify how many. 
Expenditures may further increase for legal and human resource advisers to help manage 
the collective bargaining process if nontenure track faculty members elect to be represented 
by an exclusive representative. 
 
Salary expenditures for eligible nontenure track faculty may increase; however, any 
increases depend on the outcomes of actual negotiations. Health and retirement benefit 
costs may also increase, to the extent they are negotiated. The State shares in the cost of 
salary and fringe benefit increases for State-supported employees at USM, MSU, and 
SMCM.  
 
Office of Administrative Hearings 
 
The bill likely has, at a minimum, an operational impact on OAH because OAH needs to 
train its administrative law judges on the substantive areas of the bill. Actual impacts will 
ultimately depend on the number of additional hearings resulting from the bill (for instance, 
for potentially more grievance-related proceedings).
