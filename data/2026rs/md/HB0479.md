1 Annotated Code of Maryland
2 (2022 Replacement Volume and 2025 Supplement)

3 Preamble

4 WHEREAS, Maryland faces a critical shortage of qualified teachers, especially in
5 high–need schools and rural areas such as Southern Maryland where local school systems
6 report persistent vacancies in core subject areas and growing challenges in retaining
7 educators; and

8 WHEREAS, The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future calls for expanding high–quality
9 pathways into the teaching profession, increasing college readiness, and improving
10 workforce pipelines in every region of the State; and

11 WHEREAS, Nationally, early college programs have proven to increase college
12 enrollment, degree attainment, and workforce participation — particularly among
13 first–generation and low–income students — and can be leveraged to build stronger and
14 more diverse teacher pipelines; and

15 WHEREAS, Despite strong national evidence of success, Maryland lags behind most
16 states in providing early postsecondary opportunities for its students; and

17 WHEREAS, As of 2023, Maryland ranked low nationally for dual enrollment
18 participation as a percent of high school enrollment at 10% and ranked low nationally for
19 dual enrollment as a percent of undergraduate enrollment at 7%; and

20 WHEREAS, As of 2022, participation in dual enrollment and early college programs
21 in Maryland is overly concentrated at community colleges with only 5% of students enrolled
22 through public four–year institutions — compared to approximately 28% nationally —
23 limiting exposure to bachelor’s degree pathways, including teacher preparation programs;
24 and

25 WHEREAS, Southern Maryland’s geography, limited access to nearby four–year
26 institutions, and workforce needs make it an ideal region for a program that bridges high
27 schools, community colleges, and the University System of Maryland regional higher
28 education centers to create a seamless teacher preparation pathway; and

29 WHEREAS, Establishing a Southern Maryland Early College Teacher Pathway
30 Program will align with the Blueprint’s goals; now, therefore,

31 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
32 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
