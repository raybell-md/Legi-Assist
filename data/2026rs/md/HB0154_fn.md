Open Meetings Act - County Boards of Education - Enhanced Requirements 
(Local Boards of Education Transparency Act) 
 
 
This bill makes local boards of education and the Baltimore City Board of School 
Commissioners subject to enhanced requirements under the Open Meetings Act. 
Specifically, it requires each local board of education and the Baltimore City Board of 
School Commissioners to make publicly available on its website the agenda and minutes 
of each meeting and a live video stream of each portion of a meeting held in open session. 
The bill also requires each local board of education and the Baltimore City board of School 
Commissioners to maintain on its website a complete and unedited archived video 
recording of each open meeting where video streaming was made available for a minimum 
of five years after the date of the meeting. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  None. The bill affects only local governments. 
  
Local Effect:  Local governments may need to incur minimal one-time costs to expand 
their digital storage capabilities, but it is assumed that any such costs can be absorbed 
within existing resources. Local revenues are not affected. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal.

(1) meet in open session in places reasonably accessible to potential attendees and 
(2) provide reasonable advance notice of the time and location of meetings, including, 
when appropriate, whether any portion of a meeting will be in closed session. A “public 
body” is any entity that (1) consists of at least two individuals and (2) is created by the 
Maryland Constitution; a State statute; a county or municipal charter; a memorandum of 
understanding or a master agreement to which a majority of the county boards of education 
and the Maryland State Department of Education are signatories; an ordinance; a rule, 
resolution, or bylaw; or an executive order of the Governor or of the chief executive 
authority of a political subdivision. Exclusions from the definition of “public body” include 
juries, the Governor’s cabinet and Executive Council, judicial nominating commissions, 
and single-member entities, among others. 
 
Guidance provided by the Office of the Attorney General indicates that when the meeting 
“place” is a conference call, the public can be provided access through a call-in number or 
by access to a meeting room with a speakerphone. 
 
Agendas 
 
Generally, a public body must make an agenda available to the public prior to meeting in 
an open session. The agenda must include known items of business or topics to be 
discussed at the meeting and indicate whether the public body expects to close any portion 
of the meeting in accordance with State law. The public body is not required to include in 
the agenda any information regarding the subject matter of a closed portion of the meeting. 
If a public body is unable to comply with specified deadlines for the release of a meeting 
agenda because the meeting is scheduled in response to an emergency, a natural disaster, 
or any other unanticipated situation, the public body must make available, on request, an 
agenda of the meeting within a reasonable time after the meeting occurs. 
 
Minutes 
 
As soon as practicable after an open session, a public body must prepare minutes of the 
meeting. The minutes must reflect each item that the public body considered, the action it 
took on each item, and each vote that was recorded. If a public body meets in closed 
session, the minutes for a public body’s next open session must include a summary that 
includes specified information about the proceedings of the closed meeting. A public body 
need not prepare written minutes of an open session if (1) live and archived video or audio 
streaming of the open session is available or (2) if the public body votes on legislation and 
the individual votes taken by each participating member of the public body are promptly 
posted on the Internet. 
 
In general, with limited exceptions, minutes of a public body must be available for public 
inspection during normal business hours. A public body must retain a copy of the minutes

of each session and any specified recording for at least five years and, to the extent 
practicable, post them online. 
 
Enhanced Open Meetings Requirements 
 
Certain economic and regional development organizations and other public bodies are 
subject to additional requirements under the Open Meetings Act; the bill adds local school 
boards to the list of public bodies subject to these requirements, with some exceptions. 
Generally, these requirements include making available on the body’s website each open 
meeting agenda and other specified documents at least 48 hours in advance. The bodies 
must offer live video streaming of each portion of a meeting held in open session, as 
specified. In addition, the public body must also maintain on its website past meeting 
minutes for at least five years after the date of the meeting, and a complete and unedited 
archived video recording of the open meeting for at least one year after the date of the 
meeting (the bill requires local school boards to keep the archived video for 5 years). 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  The Department of Legislative Services advises that each local board 
of education in the State and the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners already 
provides both live and archived video streams of their meetings held in open session, 
though not necessarily on their home website. Exhibit 1 lists each website providing access 
to those live and archived video streams. Some local boards of education may need to 
conduct one-time upgrades to expand their storage capacities to allow for retention of the 
video footage for five years. However, it is assumed that any such costs can be absorbed 
within existing resources. 
 
To the extent that local boards of education convene in-person meetings outside of their 
permanent board rooms that are equipped with video streaming technology, they may incur 
additional costs to stream those meetings. However, it is assumed that any such costs are 
rare and minimal, and also absorbable.
