HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION

1 A House Joint Resolution concerning

2 Anti–Nuclear Proliferation Resolution
3 (Back From the Brink Act)

4 FOR the purpose of stating that the General Assembly joins certain other state legislative
5 bodies, counties, and municipalities in passing a Back from the Brink resolution on
6 reducing the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons; urging members of the State’s
7 Congressional Delegation to cosponsor a certain federal resolution related to the use
8 of nuclear weapons; and urging the U.S. President and the U.S. Senate to endorse
9 the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

10 WHEREAS, Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever created by
11 mankind; and

12 WHEREAS, 90% of nuclear weapons are controlled by the U.S. and Russia, with the
13 rest being controlled by seven other countries: China, France, Israel, India, North Korea,
14 Pakistan, and the United Kingdom; and

15 WHEREAS, The use of even a small fraction of nuclear weapons, such as 100
16 Hiroshima–sized bombs, which are small bombs by modern standards, could put at least
17 5.5 million tons of soot into the atmosphere and cause climate disruption across the planet,
18 cutting food production and putting 250 million people at risk of starvation; and

19 WHEREAS, A large–scale nuclear war would kill hundreds of millions of people
20 directly, risk starvation for 5 billion people worldwide including in the U.S., and cause
21 unimaginable environmental damage and catastrophic climate disruption by dropping
22 temperatures across the planet to levels not seen since the Ice Age, causing the vast

1 majority of the human race to starve and possibly cause humans to become extinct as a
2 species; and

3 WHEREAS, The U.S. and Russia rely on the assurances of deterrence, that nuclear
4 arsenals are never used, and yet there have been many close calls due to human or
5 mechanical error; and

6 WHEREAS, The U.S. President has the authority to unilaterally initiate the use of
7 nuclear weapons, and during times of crisis, individuals lower in the chain of command
8 might mistakenly do so; and

9 WHEREAS, The U.S. maintains nuclear missiles on hair–trigger alert, making them
10 capable of being launched within minutes and greatly increasing the risk of an unintended
11 or unauthorized launch, especially in current times when tensions are mounting between
12 nuclear powers and the U.S. maintains the right to initiate a nuclear launch; and

13 WHEREAS, The ongoing expenditure of $1.7 trillion over 30 years to enhance the
14 U.S. nuclear arsenal is fueling a global arms race; and

15 WHEREAS, Despite the incredible expenditure on nuclear weapons, one in six
16 military families are food insecure; and

17 WHEREAS, Marylanders paid an estimated $2.1 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2024
18 for the nuclear weapons complex; and

19 WHEREAS, Living in the shadow of Washington, D.C., Marylanders are especially
20 at risk if there is nuclear war, making it appropriate that the General Assembly of
21 Maryland urge the federal government to do everything possible to reduce the risk of
22 nuclear war starting by error or by intent; and

23 WHEREAS, Two major conflicts in 2025 involving nations that possess nuclear
24 weapons make multilateral negotiations between nuclear nations more important now than
25 ever; and

26 WHEREAS, In July 2017, the United Nations adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition
27 of Nuclear Weapons which makes it illegal for ratifying nations to develop, test, produce,
28 manufacture or otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile, transfer, use, or threaten the use
29 of nuclear weapons; and

30 WHEREAS, As of September 24, 2025, 74 nations have ratified or acceded to the
31 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons; and

32 WHEREAS, House Resolution 77 introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives
33 in the 118th Congress embraced the goals and provisions of the Treaty on the Prohibition
34 of Nuclear Weapons, as well as the five policies of Back from the Brink to: (1) actively
35 pursue a multilateral verifiable agreement among nuclear armed states to eliminate their
36 nuclear arsenals; (2) renounce the option of using nuclear weapons first; (3) end the

8 passing a Back from the Brink resolution; and be it further

9 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly of Maryland urges members of the

13 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly of Maryland urges the U.S. President and
14 the U.S. Senate to endorse the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons; and be it
15 further

16 RESOLVED, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by the Department of
17 Legislative Services to the Governor of Maryland; the President of the Senate of Maryland;
18 the Speaker of the House of Delegates; and the Maryland Congressional Delegation; and
19 be it further

20 RESOLVED, That certified copies of this Joint Resolution be sent by the Secretary
