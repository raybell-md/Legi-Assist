HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION

1 A House Joint Resolution concerning

2 United States of America – National Infrastructure Bank

3 FOR the purpose of urging the U.S. Congress to pass federal legislation to establish a
4 national infrastructure bank; and generally relating to a national infrastructure
5 bank.

6 WHEREAS, The United States of America lacks critical investment in infrastructure
7 projects; and

8 WHEREAS, The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its 2025 report card,
9 assigned the United States a grade of C regarding the then–current state of infrastructure,
10 and estimated that more than $9 trillion would be needed to restore the nation’s
11 infrastructure to a state of good repair, of which nearly $4 trillion was then unfunded and
12 the remainder was inadequately funded, with new 21st–century projects also unfunded;
13 and

14 WHEREAS, Maryland is in dire need of substantial infrastructure investment and
15 improvement to protect the State’s economy and improve its quality of life; and

16 WHEREAS, According to the American Road and Transportation Builders
17 Association, Maryland has 1,563 bridges in need of repairs and, following the collapse of
18 the Francis Scott Key Bridge, there are now 240 “structurally deficient” bridges standing
19 in Maryland; and

20 WHEREAS, Maryland’s drinking water infrastructure is aging, with Baltimore City
21 recently averaging 1,000 water breaks per year, with high costs for stormwater repair and
22 replacement and the replacement of lead water service lines projected to cost more than
23 $75 million; and

1 WHEREAS, Maryland needs roughly 100,000 new units of affordable housing to
2 address the needs of its most housing–insecure residents; and

3 WHEREAS, Traffic congestion in the Baltimore metropolitan area costs each driver
4 $1,371 per year in lost time and wasted fuel, and the average driver in the Washington,
5 D.C., suburban area loses 100 hours per year due to traffic, with a cost of $2,465 per driver
6 per year, and statewide, drivers lose $5.8 billion each year in lost time and fuel due to
7 congestion; and

8 WHEREAS, Congress has introduced H.R. 5356, the “National Infrastructure Bank
9 Act,” which would create a $5 trillion bank to finance all infrastructure requirements,
10 including bringing the nation’s infrastructure to a state of good repair and building new
11 projects; and

12 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is modeled on previous banks that
13 helped build much of the nation’s infrastructure under Presidents George Washington,
14 John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the last such bank
15 played a key role in lifting the nation out of the Great Depression and supporting efforts
16 during World War II; and

17 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is projected to create 25 million new
18 jobs, pay Davis–Bacon wages, enforce Buy America provisions, ensure significant
19 disbursements to disadvantaged business enterprises, and mandate large–scale minority
20 hiring, all without requiring new federal spending or taxes and, according to experts, is
21 expected to grow the economy by 5% per year, as previous infrastructure banks did; and

22 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank will collaborate with states to finance
23 the total buildout of broadband, repair all roads and bridges, expand the power grid, fix all
24 drinking water and wastewater systems, invest in affordable housing, replace all lead
25 water service lines, expand mass transit, finance the capital needs of the Washington Metro
26 system, fund high–speed rail in the Northeast Corridor, and more; and

27 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is overwhelmingly supported, with
28 30 state legislatures that have introduced or passed resolutions of support, as well as
29 county and city councils, and national organizations such as the National Black Caucus of
30 State Legislators, the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, the National
31 Asian Pacific American Caucus of State Legislators, the Council of State
32 Governments East, the National Association of Counties, the National Association of
33 Development Organizations, the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, the National
34 Association of Minority Contractors, the National Jobs for All Network, the Federation for
35 a Manufacturing Renaissance, and others; now, therefore, be it

36 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That the members
37 of the U.S. Congress are urged to pass H.R. 5356 to establish the National Infrastructure
38 Bank to finance urgently needed infrastructure projects; and be it further
