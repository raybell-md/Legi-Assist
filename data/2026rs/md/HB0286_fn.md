(Chair, Judiciary Committee)(By Request - Departmental 
- Transportation) 
Judiciary 
 
 
Vehicle Laws - Ignition Interlock System Program - Required Participation 
 
 
This departmental bill specifies that an individual must participate in the Ignition Interlock 
System Program (IISP) as a condition of modification of a suspension or revocation of a 
license or issuance of a restricted license if the individual violates an alcohol restriction 
imposed under Title 16 of the Transportation Article. (Currently, only individuals younger 
than age 21 are subject to this requirement.) Consistent with existing statute, if such an 
individual fails to successfully complete participation in IISP, the individual is subject to a 
one‑year mandatory license suspension.

Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Pursuant to § 21-902 of the Transportation Article, an individual may not 
drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while (1) under the influence of alcohol or under the 
influence of alcohol per se; (2) impaired by alcohol; (3) impaired by a drug, any 
combination of drugs, or any combination of drugs and alcohol; or (4) impaired by a 
controlled dangerous substance. Driving under the influence of alcohol per se means

driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or higher. BAC is measured, at 
the time of testing, as grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 
210 liters of breath. 
 
Alcohol Restrictions on Driver’s Licenses 
 
The Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) is required to place an alcohol restriction on 
the license of every driver younger than age 21. The restriction prohibits the driver from 
driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while having alcohol in the blood. The 
restriction expires when the driver reaches the age of 21.  
 
Additionally, MVA must impose an alcohol restriction on an individual’s driver’s license 
that prohibits them from driving or attempting to drive with alcohol in their blood for a 
period of three years if the individual is convicted – within a five-year period – of any 
combination of two or more violations of driving while under the influence of alcohol or 
under the influence of alcohol per se; impaired by alcohol; or impaired by a drug, any 
combination of drugs, or any combination of drugs and alcohol. This restriction may 
include a prohibition on the individual driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle unless 
the individual participates in IISP.  
 
Required Ignition Interlock System Use  
 
The following drivers are required to participate in IISP and face an indefinite mandatory 
license suspension if they fail to participate or successfully complete the program: 
 
 
a person convicted of, or granted probation before judgment (PBJ) for, driving or 
attempting to drive under the influence of alcohol, under the influence of alcohol 
per se, or while impaired by alcohol (including a person whose license is suspended 
or revoked for a conviction of these offenses under a specified provision or for an 
accumulation of points for these violations); 
 
a person required to participate by court order due to a conviction for driving while 
impaired by alcohol or while impaired by a drug, any combination of drugs, or a 
combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, and the trier of fact found beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the person refused a requested test;  
 
a person convicted of homicide by motor vehicle while under the influence of 
alcohol or under the influence of alcohol per se; impaired by alcohol; or impaired 
by a drug, a combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and 
alcohol; and 
 
a person convicted of life-threatening injury by motor vehicle while under the 
influence of alcohol or under the influence of alcohol per se; impaired by alcohol;

or impaired by a drug, a combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more 
drugs and alcohol. 
 
The following drivers are required to participate in IISP as a condition of modification of 
a suspension or revocation of a license or issuance of a restricted license and face a one‑year 
mandatory license suspension if they fail to participate or successfully complete 
participation in the program: 
 
 
a driver ordered by a criminal court to participate in the program for a drunk driving 
offense; or 
 
a driver younger than age 21 who violated the alcohol restriction on the driver’s 
license or violated the prohibition on driving while impaired by a drug or a 
combination of drugs and alcohol. 
 
In addition to any other penalty, a court may prohibit an individual from driving a motor 
vehicle without an ignition interlock device for up to three years if the person is convicted 
of or granted PBJ for driving under the influence of alcohol, driving under the influence of 
alcohol per se, or driving while impaired by alcohol.  
 
An individual who is not otherwise required to participate in IISP may participate under 
specified circumstances, including if the individual’s license is suspended or revoked for 
driving while impaired by a drug or a combination of drugs and alcohol, if the individual’s 
license has an alcohol restriction, or if MVA modifies a license suspension or issues the 
individual a restricted license.  
 
Background:  MDOT advises that the bill is intended to allow individuals age 21 and older 
who violate an existing alcohol restriction on their driver’s licenses to opt into IISP without 
having to appear before an administrative law judge. Currently, MVA only offers 
enrollment in IISP to individuals who violate an alcohol restriction on their licenses if they 
are younger than age 21; individuals age 21 or older who violate an alcohol restriction on 
their licenses must appear before an administrative law judge and request that their license 
suspensions be altered to allow for enrollment in IISP. According to MDOT, the bill will 
decrease the number of hearing requests through the Office of Administrative Hearings for 
violations of license restrictions on alcohol.
