Judiciary 
 
 
Adult Protective Services – Modifications 
 
 
This departmental bill makes numerous changes to statutory provisions related to the 
reporting and investigation of abuse, neglect, self‐neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable 
adults. This includes (1) expanding reporting methods to include an online reporting portal; 
(2) requiring local departments of social services to include as part of an investigation a 
determination of whether the vulnerable adult is at risk of harm; (3) requiring local 
departments to make a finding that abuse was indicated, not indicated, or undetermined; 
(4) repealing a provision that an investigation must be completed within 10 days if the 
report indicates that an emergency exists; and (5) altering and establishing numerous 
definitions. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect State operations or 
expenditures. The bill may help protect federal funding by ensuring that the State is in 
compliance with federal requirements. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill does not materially affect local government operations or finances.  
 
Small Business Effect:  The Department of Human Services (DHS) has determined that 
this bill has minimal or no impact on small business (attached). The Department of 
Legislative Services concurs with this assessment.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill modifies and establishes numerous definitions that generally set 
forth requirements as to how allegations of abuse, neglect, self‐neglect, and exploitation of 
vulnerable adults are reported and investigated. For example, the bill: 
 
 
expands the definition of “abuse” to include psychological harm or sexual abuse and 
adds a qualifier that the act is perpetrated by an individual in a relationship of trust 
with the vulnerable adult; 
 
alters the definition of “exploitation” to specify that any action must involve the 
nonconsensual misuse of a vulnerable adult’s funds or property by an individual in 
a relationship of trust with the vulnerable adult; 
 
modifies the definition of “neglect” to include a qualifier that the act is perpetrated 
by an individual in a relationship of trust with the vulnerable adult; 
 
defines “psychological harm” as the observable, identifiable, and substantial 
impairment of a vulnerable adult’s ability to function due to severe emotional 
distress caused by an intentional act or series of acts; and 
 
defines “risk of harm” as the strong likelihood that an individual will imminently 
experience an event, condition, injury, or other outcome that is adverse or 
detrimental to the individual. 
 
The bill also defines “indicated,” “not indicated,” and “undetermined” for purposes of 
investigative findings. 
 
Current Law: 
 
Reporting Requirements  
 
A “vulnerable adult” is an adult who lacks the physical or mental capacity to provide for 
the adult’s daily needs. In general, each health practitioner, police officer, or human service 
worker who contacts, examines, attends, or treats an alleged vulnerable adult, and who has 
reason to believe that the alleged vulnerable adult has been subjected to abuse, neglect, 
self-neglect, or exploitation must (1) notify the local department of social services and  
(2) if acting as a staff member of a hospital or public health agency, immediately notify 
and give required information to the head of the institution (or a designee). Additionally, 
any individual other than a health practitioner, human service worker, or police officer who 
has reason to believe that an alleged vulnerable adult has been subjected to abuse, neglect, 
self-neglect, or exploitation may file an oral or written report of the suspected abuse, 
neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation with the local department. Reports may be made by 
telephone, direct communication, in writing to the local department, or by calling the 
statewide reporting hotline.

HB 282/ Page 3 
To the extent it is reasonably possible, an individual who makes a report must include the 
following information:  (1) the name, age, and home address of the alleged vulnerable 
adult; (2) the name and home address of the person responsible for the care of the alleged 
vulnerable adult; (3) the whereabouts of the alleged vulnerable adult; (4) the nature of the 
alleged vulnerable adult’s incapacity; (5) the nature and extent of the abuse, neglect, 
self-neglect, or exploitation of the alleged vulnerable adult, as specified; and (6) any other 
information that would help to determine the cause of the suspected abuse, neglect, 
self-neglect, or exploitation and the identity of any individual responsible for the 
maltreatment. 
 
Investigation Requirements 
 
The local department of social services must begin a thorough investigation within 
five working days after the receipt of the report of suspected abuse, neglect, self-neglect, 
or exploitation or within 24 hours after the receipt of the report if the report indicates that 
an emergency exists. The investigation must include: 
 
 
a determination of whether the individual is a vulnerable adult and there has been 
abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation; and  
 
if the individual is determined to be a vulnerable adult and to have suffered abuse, 
neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation (1) a determination of the nature, extent, and 
cause of the abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation; (2) a determination of the 
identity of the person or persons responsible; (3) an evaluation of the home 
environment; and (4) a determination of any other pertinent facts. 
 
On request of the local department, the local State’s Attorney or the appropriate law 
enforcement agency must assist in the investigation. As appropriate, specified entities 
providing services or care to the alleged vulnerable adult or whose information or expertise 
may be of assistance in assessing risk or planning services may assist in the investigation 
on request by the local department. An investigation must be completed within 60 days, or 
10 days if the report indicates that an emergency exists.  
 
Based on the investigation, the local department must (1) render or assist a vulnerable adult 
to receive the appropriate services in the best interests of the vulnerable adult under the 
adult protective services (APS) program; (2) as appropriate, involve the local office on 
aging; (3) report to the appropriate local law enforcement agency any incident of abuse, 
neglect, or exploitation of an alleged vulnerable adult where the possibility of a crime being 
committed against the alleged vulnerable adult is indicated by information provided in the 
initial report or by information obtained in the course of investigation; and (4) send to the 
local State’s Attorney and the appropriate local law enforcement agency a report of the 
investigation of any incident of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an alleged vulnerable

adult, which was or should have been reported to the appropriate local law enforcement 
agency. 
 
Background:  DHS advises that a federal 2024 rule creates minimum standards for states’ 
APS programs. In order to comply by the required date of May 2028, numerous changes 
to statutory language are required; the bill aligns definitions related to the State APS 
program with the new federal rule.
