6 to federal funds for which they are eligible.

7 Further provided that the Maryland State
8 Department of Education shall:

9 (1) Assure that the process for
10 textbook, computer hardware, and
11 computer software acquisition uses

5 admissions, retention, or
6 expulsion or otherwise
7 discriminate against any
8 student based on race, color,
9 national origin, sexual

11 identity or expression. If a
12 nonpublic school does not
13 comply with these
14 requirements, it shall
15 reimburse MSDE all
16 scholarship funds received
17 under the BOOST Program
18 for the 2025–2026 school
19 year and may not charge the
20 student tuition and fees
21 instead. The only other legal
22 remedy for violation of this
23 provision is ineligibility for
24 participating in the BOOST
25 Program.

26 (2) MSDE shall establish procedures
27 for the application and award
28 process for scholarships for
29 students who are eligible for the
30 free or reduced–price lunch

9 the President of the Senate, 2
10 members appointed by the Speaker
11 of the House of Delegates, and 1

13 President and the Speaker to serve
14 as the chair. A member of the
15 BOOST Advisory Board may not be
16 an elected official and may not have
17 any financial interest in an eligible
18 nonpublic school.

19 (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
20 review and certify the ranked list of
21 applicants and shall determine the
22 scholarship award amounts. The
23 BOOST Advisory Board shall take
24 into account the needs of students
25 with disabilities on an
26 Individualized Education Plan or

28 scholarship award amounts.

29 (7) MSDE shall make scholarship
30 awards to eligible students as
31 determined by the BOOST Advisory
32 Board.

3 (a) To allot all or any portion of the funds herein appropriated to the various
4 departments, boards, commissions, officers, schools and institutions by monthly, quarterly
5 or seasonal periods and by objects of expense.

6 The Secretary shall, before the beginning of the fiscal year, file with the Comptroller
7 of the Treasury a list limited to the appropriations restricted in this Act to be placed in
8 contingency reserve. The Comptroller shall not authorize any expenditure or obligation in
9 excess of the allotment made and any expenditure so made shall be illegal.

10 (b) To fix the number and classes of positions, including temporary and
11 permanent positions, or person years of authorized employment for each agency, unit, or
12 program thereof, not inconsistent with the Public General Laws in regard to classification
13 of positions. The Secretary shall make such determinations before the beginning of the
14 fiscal year and shall base them on the positions or person years of employment authorized
15 in the budget as amended by approved budgetary position actions. No payment for salaries
16 or wages nor any request for or certification of personnel shall be made except in accordance
17 with the Secretary’s determinations. At any time during the fiscal year the Secretary may
18 amend the number and classes of positions or person years of employment previously fixed
19 by the Secretary; the Secretary may delegate all or part of this authority. The governing
20 boards of public institutions of higher education shall have the authority to transfer
21 positions between programs and campuses under each institutional board’s jurisdiction
22 without the approval of the Secretary, as provided in Section 15–105 of the Education
23 Article.

24 (c) To prescribe procedures and forms for carrying out the above provisions.

25 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That in accordance with Section
26 7–109 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, it is the intention of the General
27 Assembly to include herein a listing of nonclassified flat rate or per diem positions by unit
28 of State government, job classification, the number in each job classification and the
29 amount proposed for each classification. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
30 Maryland may make adjustments to positions contained in the Judicial portion of this
31 section (including judges) that are impacted by changes in salary plans or by salary actions
32 in the executive agencies. Eligible positions in this section will receive the cost of living
33 adjustments (COLA) and salary increments included in the fiscal 2027 budget according to
34 the same schedule as positions in the Standard Pay Plan.
