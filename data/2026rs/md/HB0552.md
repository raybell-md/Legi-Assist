A BILL ENTITLED

1 AN ACT concerning

2 Independent Investigation of the House of Reformation and Instruction for
3 Colored Children

4 FOR the purpose of establishing the Independent Investigation of the House of Reformation
5 and Instruction for Colored Children; and generally relating to the Independent
6 Investigation of the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children.

7 Preamble

8 WHEREAS, The State of Maryland established the House of Reformation and
9 Instruction for Colored Children (also known under various historical names) in Prince
10 George’s County for over a century as a detention and reformatory institution for youth;
11 and

12 WHEREAS, Recent reports and historical records have brought to light the existence
13 of a neglected cemetery on the grounds of the former institution containing the unmarked
14 graves of hundreds of deceased children, primarily African American boys, who died while
15 in the care and custody of the State; and

16 WHEREAS, The condition of this burial ground represents a profound and
17 long–standing failure of the State to provide dignity in death to children for whom it had
18 assumed responsibility in life, and this neglect has hidden a painful chapter of Maryland’s
19 history from public view and accountability; and

20 WHEREAS, The State of Maryland has a solemn moral and civic duty to the
21 deceased, their families, and all its citizens to uncover the full truth of what occurred at the
22 House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children, to account for every child
