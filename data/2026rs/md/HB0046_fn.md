(Delegate Queen) 
Ways and Means 
 
 
Sports Wagering - Gambling Prevention Technology Pilot Program - 
Establishment 
 
 
This bill establishes the Gambling Prevention Technology Pilot Program in the 
State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (SLGCC), which Bowie State University 
(BSU) and Morgan State University (MSU) must participate in. Online sports wagering 
operators must (1) establish a geofence (virtual perimeter) encompassing designated no 
gambling zones on each participating campus that prevents online sports wagering access 
within the boundary and (2) collaborate with SLGCC to enforce and implement the no 
gambling zones. By January 1, 2031, SLGCC must submit a report to the Governor and 
the General Assembly on its findings from the pilot program. The bill takes effect 
July 1, 2026, and terminates June 30, 2031. 
  
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General fund expenditures for the State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency 
(SLGCA) increase by $90,600 in FY 2027. Future years reflect annualization, inflation, 
and termination of contractual staff in FY 2031. Sports wagering revenues are not 
materially affected.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The purpose of the pilot program is to (1) identify strategies for reducing 
or mitigating the negative effects of problem gambling by students on college campuses in 
the State; (2) compile and analyze data on the viability of utilizing technology to reduce 
problem gambling; and (3) gain insights to improve enforcement of existing online sports 
wagering laws in the State. 
 
SLGCC, in collaboration with BSU, MSU, and the Maryland Center of Excellence on 
Problem Gambling, must (1) identify areas on participants’ campuses to be no gambling 
zones; (2) develop signage for these zones; and (3) identify and implement any 
cost‑effective technologies that further the goals of the pilot program, including real-time 
monitoring of online sports wagering activity. 
 
If an individual attempts to participate in online sports wagering while within the 
designated geofence, the individual must be prevented from online sports wagering and 
shown a warning that contains information on the pilot program and options for obtaining 
responsible gambling assistance. 
 
SLGCC must determine the time frame and necessary steps to establish the pilot program. 
SLGCC may not fine, penalize, or otherwise sanction an online sports wagering operator 
for unforeseeable technological failures that occur within the geofenced boundaries during 
the pilot program. 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 492 of 2020, a constitutional amendment approved by the voters 
at the November 2020 general election, authorized sports and event wagering, contingent 
upon implementation legislation passed by the General Assembly. Chapter 356 of 2021 
implemented sports wagering in the State and provides for regulation of sports wagering 
and fantasy gaming competitions, including through mobile applications. Other forms of 
online gaming are not currently authorized in Maryland, but legislation has been introduced 
in prior years to authorize Internet gambling and online lottery sales. 
 
Under Chapter 356, specified individuals (including those younger than age 21; those not 
physically present in the State; and athletes, coaches, referees, directors, or employees of a 
sports governing entity or any of its member teams) may not wager on a sporting event; 
likewise, a sports wagering licensee may not accept a wager from those individuals. 
However, otherwise, a sports wagering facility licensee may accept wagers made by an 
individual physically present on the licensee’s property, including wagers on a self-service 
kiosk, device, or machine at that property. Likewise, a mobile sports wagering licensee 
may only accept wagers by an individual physically located in the State. To participate in 
online sports wagering, an individual must register using a website or mobile application 
approved by SLGCC, or in person at specified facilities.

HB 46/ Page 3 
For online sports wagering, a mobile sports wagering licensee must have technical and 
operational measures in place to prevent access by individuals who are underage or 
physically located outside the State, including age verification procedures and the use of 
geolocation technology to verify a bettor’s geographic location.  
 
Appendix – Maryland Gaming provides the status of gaming in Maryland as of 
December 2025. 
 
Problem Gambling 
 
Video lottery operation licensees must pay an annual fee of $425 per video lottery terminal 
for a Problem Gambling Fund administered by the Maryland Department of Health 
(MDH), and SLGCC has established an annual fee of $500 per table game for the Problem 
Gambling Fund. Additionally, any sports wagering winnings on a sports event not claimed 
within 182 days after the wager is won revert to the Problem Gambling Fund. The Problem 
Gambling Fund is used to fund programs to treat and prevent gambling addiction. After 
satisfying specified requirements, any unspent funds in the Problem Gambling Fund may 
be expended by MDH on drug and other addiction treatment services. 
 
The Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling is a program of the University 
of Maryland School of Medicine and funded by MDH’s Behavioral Health Administration 
through the Problem Gambling Fund. The primary goal of the center is to minimize the 
risks and problems associated with gambling in the State. 
 
State Revenues:  Establishing geofencing in designated no gambling zones on campus at 
MSU and BSU prohibits mobile sports wagering in those areas. However, those zones are 
small enough to not have a material effect on sports wagering revenues. 
 
State Expenditures:  SLGCA has determined that one program manager, one research 
analyst, and one research statistician are needed to implement this bill. However, the 
Department of Legislative Services (DLS) advises that one program manager could likely 
handle the added responsibilities incurred by this legislation, which are not permanent and, 
thus, may be performed by a contractual employee. Thus, general fund expenditures for 
SLGCA increase by $90,565 in fiscal 2027, which accounts for a 90-day start-up delay 
from the bill’s July 1, 2026 effective date. This estimate reflects the cost of hiring one 
contractual program manager to run the pilot program under the bill. It includes a salary, 
fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses.

Future year expenditures reflect a full salary with annual increases and employee turnover 
as well as annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. The contractual position is 
assumed to terminate concurrent with the requirement to report on the pilot program. 
 
This estimate does not include any health insurance costs that could be incurred for 
specified contractual employees under the State’s implementation of the federal Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
 
Bowie State University and Morgan State University 
 
BSU notes that it can consult and collaborate on boundaries, offer design ideas for signs, 
and advise and collaborate on strategies SLGCC identifies with existing resources. 
 
MSU reports that the bill imposes a substantial and sustained operational and fiscal burden 
on MSU and estimates needing three full-time positions and two graduate assistant 
positions to implement the bill, along with consulting expenses. DLS disagrees, as the bill 
only requires MSU and BSU to collaborate with SLGCC; SLGCC is responsible for 
implementing and reporting on the pilot program. As such, BSU and MSU can collaborate 
with SLGCC with existing resources.
