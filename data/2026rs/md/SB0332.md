1 (iii) 1. If the cause of any damage to or destruction of any portion

25 owners in proportion to their percentage interest in the common elements.

26 (4) (i) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit’s entire
27 common element interest, votes in the council of unit owners, and common expense liability
28 are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under §
29 11–112 of this title, and the council of unit owners promptly shall prepare, execute, and
30 record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.
