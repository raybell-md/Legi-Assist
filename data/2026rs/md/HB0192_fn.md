House Bill 192 
(Delegate Woods) 
Appropriations 
 
 
Maryland Higher Education Commission - Religious Educational Institutions - 
Certificate of Approval 
 
 
This bill exempts an accredited religious educational institution that was authorized to 
operate in the State before January 1, 2013, and has since been in continuous operation in 
the State, from the requirement to obtain a certificate of approval (COA) from the 
Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) to operate in Maryland. However, an 
accredited religious educational institution that was established on or after January 1, 2013, 
must still obtain a COA from MHEC to operate in the State. The bill takes effect 
July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  No significant impact on MHEC’s administrative operations, special fund 
revenues, or expenditures. 
  
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Most postsecondary educational institutions must obtain a COA from 
MHEC or register with MHEC (for fully online distance education programs) before they 
are allowed to operate in the State. However, certain institutions are exempt from 
registering with or obtaining a COA from MHEC. These institutions are either under 
charter from the General Assembly or religious institutions meeting certain qualifications.

HB 192/ Page 2 
Chapter 14 of 2013 (which took effect July 1, 2013), clarified and altered the conditions 
under which MHEC may authorize religious educational institutions to operate without a 
COA. Specifically, a religious educational institution may operate without a COA and may 
enroll Maryland students in a fully online distance educational program in the State without 
registering if the institution (1) is established for religious educational purposes; 
(2) provides educational programs only for religious vocations or purposes; (3) offers only 
sectarian instruction designed for and aimed at individuals who hold or seek to learn the 
particular religious faiths or beliefs taught by the institution; and (4) states on the certificate 
or diploma the religious nature of the award. 
 
A religious educational institution that is accredited by an accrediting body recognized by 
the U.S. Department of Education may not operate without a COA from MHEC. 
 
Each religious educational institution authorized to operate without a COA or without 
registering must submit to MHEC a renewal application every two years that includes 
specified information. 
 
According to the Code of Maryland Regulations, an institution seeking an exemption as a 
religious educational institution must submit an application, a financial statement, and the 
documentation required by the Secretary of Higher Education – including the proposed 
catalog of courses and evidence from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation 
that the institution is in good standing. In addition, the institution must submit an 
application fee of $250. An exemption is valid for two years. For a renewal application, an 
institution must submit the same materials and a renewal application fee of $250. A renewal 
exemption is valid for two years. Since fiscal 2014, revenues from application and renewal 
fees have been deposited into a special fund within MHEC. 
 
Other institutions of higher education are not required to accept, for transfer, credit from a 
general education course or any other course offered by an exempt religious institution. In 
addition, there are other limitations on courses offered by exempt religious institution. Prior 
to enrolling, a student must be given written notice of these limitations. 
 
A person is prohibited from making a verbal or written statement that an institution of 
postsecondary education operating without a COA issued by MHEC is approved by, or has 
a COA from, MHEC. In addition, a person may not enroll a student in the institution unless 
the person gives written notice that the student acknowledges certain limitations of the 
instructional program, including that an institution of higher education is not required to 
accept, for transfer, credits earned at the institution. A violator is subject to a fine of up to 
$5,000 for each violation.

Certificate of Approval Process 
 
The two-stage institutional approval process for in-State institutions seeking to operate in 
Maryland is established in regulations. 
 
Stage One Approval:  Institutions must submit a stage one application, including evidence 
of regional or statewide need, financial viability, and proposed degree programs and 
operations. Institutions must also pay a nonrefundable application fee of $7,500 for up to 
two degree programs and an additional $850 per program beyond two. Once submitted, the 
application is subject to public notice and a 30-day comment period, during which other 
institutions may object. If approved by the Secretary of Higher Education, the institution 
may proceed to stage two. 
 
Stage Two Approval:  Upon stage one approval, institutions must submit further 
documentation, including evidence of insurance, financial guarantees, and business 
licensing. The Secretary appoints an evaluation team to conduct an on-site visit to ensure 
compliance. The institution is responsible for all associated costs. 
 
Final Decision and Certificate of Approval:  If the institution meets all regulatory 
requirements, the Secretary may grant approval and issue a COA, for a period of time as 
may be considered appropriate, specifying the degree programs and locations permitted. If 
denied, institutions receive a notice of deficiencies and may request a hearing before 
MHEC.  
 
Post-approval Review:  Newly approved institutions undergo a post-approval on-site 
review after their first instructional year to ensure continued compliance. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Institutions of higher education are generally not considered small 
businesses. 
 
Additional Comments:  MHEC notes that, in most cases, an institution must obtain state 
authorization to operate before it can receive accreditation from an accrediting body 
recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Federal accreditation requirements 
generally list state authorization as a prerequisite for accreditation. Under federal 
regulations, institutions must have both state authorization (i.e., a COA) and accreditation 
to qualify for federal financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and student loans. The 
state must take an active role in approving or licensing institutions for it to count as state 
authorization. More specifically, to meet federal requirements, the state must actively 
oversee the approval or licensing of institutions rather than merely provide a formal 
designation.
