Family Law - Children in Need of Assistance and Termination of Parental Rights 
(Right to Fight Act) 
 
 
This bill repeals provisions that (1) in regard to a child in need of assistance (CINA) 
proceeding, authorize a local department of social services to ask the juvenile court to find 
that reasonable efforts to reunify a child with the child’s parent or guardian are not required 
if the local department concludes that a parent or guardian has involuntarily lost parental 
rights to a sibling of the child and (2) allow a juvenile court in ruling on a petition for 
guardianship of a child, upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the parent 
has involuntarily lost parental rights to a sibling of a child, to waive a local department’s 
obligations to provide certain services.

Child in Need of Assistance Petitions – Waiver of Reunification Efforts 
 
A CINA is a child who requires court intervention because (1) the child has been abused 
or neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder and (2) the child’s

parents, guardian, or custodian is unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to 
the child and the child’s needs. 
 
In a CINA petition, a local department may ask the court to find that reasonable efforts to 
reunify a child with the child’s parent or guardian are not required if the local department 
concludes that a parent or guardian has (1) subjected the child to specified aggravated 
circumstances; (2) been convicted, in any state or any court of the United States, of a crime 
of violence against a minor offspring of the parent or guardian, the child, or another parent 
or guardian of the child, or of aiding or abetting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit a crime 
of violence under these circumstances; or (3) involuntarily lost parental rights of a sibling 
of the child. 
 
If the local department determines after the initial petition is filed that any of the 
circumstances specified above exists, the local department may immediately request the 
court to find that reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the child’s parent or guardian 
are not required. 
 
If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that any of the circumstances specified 
above exists, the court must waive the requirement that reasonable efforts be made to 
reunify the child with the child’s parent or guardian. If the court finds that reasonable 
efforts are not required, the local department must (1) request that a permanency planning 
hearing be held within 30 days of the court’s finding, as specified in statute, and (2) make 
reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency 
plan and complete the steps necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. 
 
If a parent consents to the guardianship or adoption in accordance with Family Law 
Article §§ 5-320 or 5-338, as specified, loss of parental rights must be considered 
voluntary. 
 
Nonconsensual Guardianship Petitions  
 
If, after the consideration of specified factors (as generally required in Family Law 
Article § 5-323, subject to limited exception), a juvenile court finds by clear and 
convincing evidence that a parent is unfit to remain in a parental relationship with the child 
or that exceptional circumstances exist that would make a continuation of the parental 
relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child such that terminating the rights of 
the parent is in the child’s best interests, the juvenile court may grant guardianship of the 
child without consent otherwise required under applicable statute and over the child’s 
objection. 
 
In ruling on a petition for guardianship of a child, a juvenile court must give primary 
consideration to the health and safety of the child and consideration to all other factors

needed to determine whether the termination of a parent’s rights is in the child’s best 
interests. Among other things, such factors include consideration of: 
 
 
all services offered to the parent before the child’s placement and the extent to which 
a local department of social services and parent have fulfilled their obligations under 
any social services agreement (unless a court waives reunification efforts under 
§ 3-812(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (as discussed above)); 
 
the results of the parent’s effort to adjust the parent’s circumstances, condition, or 
conduct to make it in the child’s best interests for the child to be returned to the 
parent’s home, as specified; 
 
any abuse or neglect of the child or a minor, including any exposure of the child to 
drugs during the mother’s pregnancy; 
 
whether the parent has involuntarily lost parental rights to a sibling of the child; and 
 
the child’s emotional ties with and feelings toward the child’s parents and siblings, 
the likely impact of terminating parental rights on the child’s well-being, and the 
child’s adjustment to community, home, placement, and school. 
 
A juvenile court need not consider any factor discussed above in determining a child’s best 
interests if, after a thorough investigation by a local department, the juvenile court finds 
that (1) the identities of the child’s parents are unknown and (2) during the 60 days 
immediately after the child’s adjudication as a CINA, no one has claimed to be the child’s 
parent. 
 
A juvenile court may waive a local department’s obligations for services if the juvenile 
court finds by clear and convincing evidence that one or more certain acts or circumstances 
exists, including whether the parent has involuntarily lost parental rights to a sibling of the 
child. The juvenile court must then also, based on facts in the record, make a specific 
finding as to whether return of the child to a parent’s custody poses an unacceptable risk 
to the child’s future safety. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  The bill’s implementation may result in additional expenses for DHS, 
to the extent that services are provided to families who would not otherwise receive them 
due to existing statutory provisions regarding waivers and services. DHS anticipates that 
by decreasing the number of cases where a waiver of the obligation to provide services 
may be attained, expenditures may increase by an estimated $300,000 on an annual basis. 
According to DHS, cases may take longer to resolve, thereby increasing expenditures 
related to case management and monthly care stipends; direct costs for other services may 
also be incurred, such as those related to parenting classes, specialized therapy, and 
substance‐abuse treatment programs. General fund expenditures may therefore increase if 
additional cases require services; to the extent that certain costs are eligible for federal 
reimbursement, federal fund expenditures/revenues increase accordingly.

While acknowledging the general potential for a fiscal impact, the Department of 
Legislative Services is unable to validate the magnitude of the estimate provided by DHS. 
According to DHS, the electronic system of record does not currently track waivers for 
reunification, and it is unclear how many cases may ultimately be affected in a given year. 
For context, DHS advises that in fiscal 2025, the State had 28 children whose legal 
relationships with their biological parents were severed through a contested termination of 
parental rights hearing.
