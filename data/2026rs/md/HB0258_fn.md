Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program - 
Standards and Procedures 
 
   
This departmental bill makes clarifying and corrective changes, described below, to 
provisions governing the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection 
Program. The bill also requires that damages assessed by a circuit court for illegal cutting 
or clearing of trees in the Critical Area be paid to the applicable local jurisdiction rather 
than to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). 
   
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill is not expected to directly affect State finances. DNR indicates that 
the bill’s changes reflect current practice, including the change in the disposition of 
damages for illegal cutting or clearing of trees. DNR indicates that local jurisdictions 
currently receive any such funding, not the department.     
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not expected to directly affect local government finances. 
  
Small Business Effect:  DNR has determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services concurs with this 
assessment.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill makes various – mostly clarifying and corrective – changes to 
provisions governing the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection 
Program by:  
 
 
clarifying that the Critical Area Commission’s adoption and amendment of 
regulations must be accomplished by affirmative vote of the commission; 
 
correcting a reference to a 6-year comprehensive review of a local critical area 
program to instead refer to a 10-year comprehensive review, consistent with a 
change made under Chapter 424 of 2024 that requires a local program to review its 
program at least every 10 years instead of every 6 years; 
 
replacing the term “adjacent” with the term “contiguous and adjoining” in 
provisions governing the location of new intensely developed or limited 
development areas; 
 
clarifying that a change to a critical area designation in the Atlantic Coastal Bays 
Critical Area, due to a mistake in the original designation, must be based on land 
uses or natural features in existence on June 1, 2002, when the critical area program 
was expanded to the Atlantic Coastal Bays by Chapter 433 of 2002; 
 
making changes to provisions governing the timing of the Critical Area 
Commission’s approval of local critical area program refinements (defined under 
current law as changes determined to be consistent with the current program or 
determined to not have a significant effect) and program amendments (defined 
under current law as a change that is not determined to be a program refinement) – 
one change that is clarifying and one change that makes two separate provisions 
establishing a timeframe for the commission to act on a program amendment 
consistent; 
 
clarifying references to professionals who may prepare, oversee, and approve plans 
to replant trees to remedy illegal cutting or clearing; and 
 
requiring that damages assessed by a circuit court for illegal cutting or clearing of 
trees in the Critical Area be paid to the applicable local jurisdiction rather than DNR. 
 
Current Law/Background:  Chapter 794 of 1984 established the Chesapeake Bay Critical 
Area Protection Program (now the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area 
Protection Program) to minimize damage to water quality and wildlife habitat by fostering 
more sensitive development activity along the shoreline areas of the Chesapeake Bay and 
its tributaries. The goals of the program now are applicable to both the Chesapeake Bay 
and the Atlantic Coastal Bays (after enactment of Chapter 433) and include (1) protection 
of water quality; (2) conservation of habitat; (3) accommodation of future growth and 
development without adverse environmental impacts; (4) improvement of climate 
resiliency; and (5) equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of development,

mitigation, restoration, conservation, and climate change adaptation within the 
Critical Area. 
 
Chapter 794 identified the Critical Area as all land within 1,000 feet of the mean high water 
line of tidal waters or the landward edge of tidal wetlands and all waters of and lands under 
the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. In 2002, the Critical Area was expanded to include 
the State’s coastal bays, and, in 2024, the program was modified to incorporate climate 
resilience, environmental justice, and equity measures. The 1984 legislation also created 
the Critical Area Commission within DNR, which oversees the development and 
implementation of local land use programs dealing with the Critical Area. Each local 
jurisdiction is charged with the primary responsibility for development and implementation 
of its own local program; that local authority, however, is subject to commission review 
and approval and must be consistent with the commission’s regulations.

There will be no economic impact on Maryland small businesses. The legislation is

no increase or decrease in the costs of development associated with these statutory 
changes.
